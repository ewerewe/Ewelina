            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The purpose of this book is to make available
to its readers factual knowledge concerning parapsychology and psychic phenomena.In addition
to simple facts,presented here are proven methods
which an individual may use to develop his own
psychic abilities-for these abilities are not the
gifts of a chosen few,but belong to each of us,as an
integral part of our own human nature. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the course of teaching parapsychology at
Georgia State University,and during the years of
study prior to my teaching experience,I became
very aware that the great majority of books dealing
with parapsychology,E.S.P.,and psychic phenomena related only the personal experiences of
an individual and did nothing to actually teach a
reader to get in touch with his own abilities.This
is not such a book.The exercises included here
have been researched and have proven extremely
effective under actual learning conditions for more
than two years.They are not magic formulas but
techniques founded in science and educational
psychology which will enable a person to expand
his own potential. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If a reader is seeking absolute truths and guaranteed panaceas,this is not the book for him.Information is presented here with an attitude of
respect for an individual's right to reach his own
conclusions.It is my opinion that each individual
has an obligation to acquaint himself with facts
that will enable him to reach those conclusions,
based upon knowledge,not emotion.It is not my
purpose to convince,but to stimulate intellectual
curiosity and to provide the methods for developing individual abilities.It is through this intellectual curiosity that human potential can be recognized and expanded. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; So let us embark upon this journey together,
for as a very wise man said centuries ago,"The
beginning of wisdom is wonder!"" <br>

            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clairvoyance and
Psychometry.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clairvoyance has fascinated mankind for centuries.The literal definition of clairvoyance is
clear-seeing or clear-sight. The term clairvoyance
encompasses not only future but also past events
and those that occur at the same moment and time
but at a different location. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to fully evaluate clairvoyance as a
potential ability inherent in man it is necessary to
look at past teachings about the subject and at scientific investigations still being carried on in the
field. The ancients were aware that a select few
had the ability to look into the future. Yoga has
taught for centuries that man can set aside his conscious mind and put himself in tune with the socalled universal unconscious or cosmic mind.
Yoga also postulated the existence of the Akashic
records, which were considered to be a universal
ether that held the recorded happenings of an entire world cycle​—not just the past but also present
and future. Yogis teach that an advanced clairvoyant or others who possess occult powers of this
kind can tune themselves in with the universal
ether and “read" past, present,and future of an
entire world cycle. They believe that the records
terminate only with the ending of the particular
world cycle to which they refer. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In Greek history much belief in the Oracle of
Delphi was expressed. The Oracle, considered a
high priestess, was consulted by many rulers in
connection with personal events, wars, and strategies for battle. Hippocrates, the father of medicine,
once wrote, “The affliction suffered by the body,
the soul sees with shut eyes." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Today we are witnessing a new emphasisnew not only in time but also in that scientists are
becoming interested in clairvoyance. The list of
those who have investigated the subject is impressive and growing continuously. Dr. William McDougall, who taught at Harvard and Oxford, was
responsible for bringing Dr. J. B. Rhine and his
wife Dr. Louisa Rhine to Duke University in the
1920s to study and experiment with paranormal
happenings. Books and magazines today report the
work of Russian scientists related to clairvoyance
and other areas of parapsychology. The Czechoslovakian journal Periscope, 1966, states that the
Czech military in 1925 issued to its army a handbook, Clairvoyance, Hypnotism, and Magnetism,
by Karl Hejbalik. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Usually it is easy to accept the possibility of
somehow looking ahead in time to predict a future
event. It is often somewhat more difficult to accept
that one who has developed his inherent clairvoyant abilities can also reach into the past, perhaps into an event long forgotten, and give specific
information about a specific event in a person's
life. The idea that the past is a dead issue is challenged as someone sensitive to the past reaches
back even into the early years of childhood and
describes in detail the person's home at the time of
the event, colors in the home, medical history, and
conversations that may have occurred 20, 30, or more years ago. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; That this sort of description has in fact happened and is continuing to happen confronts
man's conception of time itself. Einstein has said
that time is relative. Time zones divide the world,
and United States residents each year through the
institution of daylight saving time, intervene and
order events by changing time itself for a particular duration. If time is indeed relative and merely
a matter of a man-made intervention to record
events in their order of occurrence,it is not difficult to accept that the mind is capable of transcending time itself. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; To consider clairvoyance in general, the
reader must acquaint himself with the idea that
the universe is filled with objects and happenings
that vibrate at different frequencies. Microwave
ovens, which cook food in a matter of seconds by
means of sound vibrations, are a concrete example
of the existence of vibrations. The human brain
itself operates and emits electrical magnetic impulses​—impulses that are released into the surrounding atmosphere and held captive by the material objects they contact. The student is here
reminded that every object, no matter how solid it
may appear to the observer, is in essence composed of millions of atoms, electrons, neutrons,
and neutrinos. Unoccupied space exists in even
the most apparently solid object. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Clairvoyance thus seems to be more intimately tied with physics and electrical engineering than with psychology. To discover the
natural laws responsible for the operations of phenomena now considered extrasensory we must
look to these sciences as well as to the nature of
the human mind. In attempting to explain clairvoyant ability we may compare the brain, emitting
electrical magnetic impulses, to a radio. That is,
one might tune in to various frequencies much as
one turns a radio dial to select a specific station.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but
merely changes from one form to another. If this
law is accepted as fact, it again becomes easier to
conceive of the mind's ability to tune itself
through various techniques and to tap energies
released into our atmosphere even centuries ago. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; That a furnace in operation emits heat is
easily determined by opening the furnace door.
When the furnace is down, heat remains in the
room, even though its initiating cause is no longer
present. So we see once again that effects released
into our surrounding atmosphere linger and can be
perceived even when the initiating cause is no
longer present. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the easiest methods of triggering clairvoyance in any individual is the technique of psychometry. Psychometry, sometimes known as object reading, is based on the idea that over long
periods of time, even centuries, vibrations are absorbed and held by material objects. Bear in mind
that an object will contain not only the vibrations
of its owner but also the vibrations of those people
who are significant in the owner's life. It is possible with psychometry, as with ordinary clairvoyance, to travel backward into a person's childhood
to deal with the present life period or to travel
forward into the person's future. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; That the vibrations of significant others in the
owner's life are also found on an object is sometimes puzzling to one who ventures for the first
time into this field. One must consider here the
possibility that in any meaningful relationship
there is an exchange of vibrational energy. One
becomes in part identified with the significant
person. To some extent one's own essence in the
vibrational field becomes colored by a meaningful
exchange with another person. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychometry, however, not only is possible
with objects of possession but also can be induced
by the use of a person's full name and through
such personal contact as hand holding. In each
case it can be said that the person is presented
with the loose end of the string that guides him
into the past, present, and future. Occult teachers
speak of the Aka thread, which can be visualized
through the analogy of a spider that weaves a web
as it moves from object to object. These threads are
thought to be lines of communication, much like
an index file in a library, which can direct a person
to the information he seeks. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Several important facts must be kept in mind
in regard to psychometry as a means of tapping
clairvoyant ability. First, and most important, is
the length of time the object has been associated
with its owner and whether the owner has been
the sole possessor of the object. Complications can
arise if the object has belonged to several different
people, any of whom is not well known to the
present owner. A person who uses the object as a
point of contact might very well pick up extremely
accurate and specific events recorded on the object—say, a wristwatch or a ring​—through the vibrations of the previous owner. If the present wearer
of the jewelry is not well acquainted with details
in the previous owner's life, accurate and specific
information may be passed over as incorrect; so it
is best to choose an object that has been associated
only with the person for whom a clairvoyant demonstration is being attempted. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, a person who uses clairvoyant ability
with or without the aid of an object is confronted
with the problems of interpretation. Impressions
come in many different ways. One person may see
pictures; another may see symbols; others may
hear voices; others report knowledge through feelings. Any combination of these various forms of
receiving impressions can be expected. Often the
information is received so quickly that while the
sensitive is relating one incident in a person's life,
another impression has already completely
formed in the mind's eye. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The process is further complicated in that
close emotional relationships are difficult to distinguish from actual blood ties. Then add that
strong desires are often indistinguishable from a
feat accomplished, and it becomes easier to see
that proficient interpretation itself takes time and
practice. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychometry is particularly advantageous in
attempting a clairvoyance demonstration with a
particular person in a crowded room. Remember
that every person in the room is giving off vibrational energy;so the use of an object that belongs
to the involved person acts as a focusing device,
making it easier to ignore crosscurrents of vibrations from everyone else in the room. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; If psychometry is to be done through the use
of a name rather than an object, the complete name
should be used-for example, John Joseph Smith,
Jr. A married woman should include her maiden
name​—for example, Mary Anne Kelly Jones. Confusion can result when a junior or senior designation is not included in the name given to the
person who is attempting the demonstration. Such
omission results usually in specific information
being picked up on both father and son. Keep in
mind that the closer the emotional tie or the more
significant the other, the stronger will be the significant other's vibrational effect in the subject's
own energy field. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Photographs also afford a means of inducing
clairvoyance through psychometry. It is interesting to note here that many primitive tribes
would not permit photographs to be taken in the
belief that the camera captured part of the individual's soul. When dealing with photographs it is
not necessary that the sensitive see the picture.
The picture may be handed to him face down and
merely held between both hands in order to receive information. Keep in mind that information
will be picked up on every person present in the
photograph, on the significant people in their
lives, and often on the person who took the picture. Actual description of the photograph's content is also possible in these cases. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Many times the subject cannot directly relate
to information given, and he must ask people
closely associated with him to aid in possible verification. In all cases, specific information and verification of facts is of utmost importance. To deal in
generalities is to demonstrate nothing in the field
of clairvoyant investigation. Whenever possible,
demonstrations should be recorded on tape and/or
written for a later verification. In no instance
should facts be twisted or otherwise turned back
in order to fit a situation or event in the subject's
life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; No profession today can claim absolute
perfection, and it is not possible in the area of
clairvoyance. The person who performs a clairvoyant demonstration would do well to remember
and remind those present during the demonstration that when dealing in such a specific manner
with clairvoyant events in a person's life the odds
are not 1 in 10, 1 in 100, or even 1 in 1,000. When
dealing in specifics-for example, “Your left
lower leg was broken at the age of seven years in a
fall down the front steps of your aunt's home" ​— the odds are one in infinity. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The clairvoyant should instruct all subjects
and observers present to make no remarks either in
word or through body language​—for example, facial gestures, looks of surprise​—until the clairvoyant has completely finished with the information he intends to convey for verification. The
clairvoyant should not look at the subject as he
relates the clairvoyant impressions received. The
less the subject and observers say before the demonstration, the better. Be on your guard against any
supposed clairvoyant who plies you with questions and watches your every move for any sign of
reaction during the demonstration. In the interest
of scientific investigation every precaution must
be taken to ensure that information received and
labeled as clairvoyant knowledge could not have
been conveyed by any ordinarily accepted means
of communication. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is quite difficult to demonstrate past-time
clairvoyance with a subject the demonstrator has
known well for an extended period of time. The
clairvoyant then must endeavor to pick up on a
time period and give minute details in order to
dispel any doubt about possible discussion of
these events prior to the demonstration. It is always much easier to demonstrate clairvoyance
with someone who is not known at all or whose
past life is not known. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When dealing with future time, clairvoyance,
or precognition, this lack of knowledge about past
events is not so important. In all precognitive
demonstrations the time period should be pinpointed as closely as possible and the event described specifically and not in generalities. For
verification of future-time clairvoyance the subject
might be requested to advise the clairvoyant when
the predicted time period has passed whether the
event actually did occur. The clairvoyant, too,
should retain a record of the events predicted, including the time in which they were to occur.
Then the clairvoyant can check with the subject in
order to maintain a more accurate record of hits
and misses. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> The ESP deck (available from the Foundation
for Research into the Nature of Man, Durham,
N.C.) consists of 25 cards with 5 symbols:circle,
plus (+) sign, star, 3 wavy lines, square. Each
symbol appears on five cards in the deck. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Down-through Method.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this exercise the cards are shuffled and cut
three times with a metal edge. The deck then is
placed aside, and on a sheet of paper, prepared in
advance, the subject notes with numbers from 1 to
25, the order in which he feels the symbols are arranged in the deck. For accuracy at least four runs
should be completed. Statistically one may expect
to have five hits by chance. The amount of deviation from five will be a measure of the amount of
clairvoyant ability being evidenced. After four
runs have been completed the subject should add&nbsp;the number of hits in each run. Chance expectations&nbsp;&nbsp;of hits for the 4 runs is 20; so approximately
28 hits&nbsp;&nbsp;would be quite in excess of the 20-to-1
odds. If the subject has scored 32 or more hits in
the 4 runs he has attained chance occurrence odds
of 250 to 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For his convenience the subject should divide
a page into columns. The left-hand column is
headed Call; the right-hand column is headed
Card. The subject notes his impressions of the
symbols in the deck, 1 through 25, in the Call
column. Then he goes through the deck one card at
a time, noting the symbols in their actual order of
appearance, 1 through 25, in the Card column.
This method allows for speedy verification. (Preprinted forms may be obtained from the Foundation for Research into the Nature of Man,Durham,

            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The subject shuffles the deck,which then
should be cut three times with a metal edge.The
subject uses the prepared sheet as mentioned
above.After the deck has been shuffled and set
aside,the subject removes the top card from the
deck and places it to the side of the stack without
looking at its face.The subject then attempts to
identify the symbol on the card and records it on
his performance sheet in the Call column.The
second card should be taken from the deck in the
same manner but not placed on top of the preceding card until the subject has attempted his
identification and reported his impression on his
performance sheet.This method is used until the
subject has gone through all 25 cards and recorded
his impressions.After the second impression has
been recorded,the second card may be placed on
top of the first card drawn so that the subject
amasses a second stack of cards.After all impressions have been recorded, the subject turns over
the new stack of cards and records the actual appearance of the symbols in the Card column. Since
the deck has been turned over, the cards will appear face up in their order of appearance 1 through
25. When four runs have been completed the odds
given above also will apply here.&nbsp;<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>—&nbsp;—&nbsp;—&nbsp;<br>

            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> General ESP.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This experiment involves two or more people.
The deck is shuffled and cut as before. One person
handles the deck while the other or others record
his impressions. Since this technique can involve
both clairvoyance and telepathy, the person designated to handle the deck is called the sender. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The sender takes one card at a time from the
deck and holds it so that only he can physically
see the symbol on the card. The sender holds a
mental image of this symbol in his mind for 10
seconds. The subject records his impressions; then
the sender picks up the next card from the deck
and follows the same procedure as with the first
card drawn. To indicate the progression to the subject the sender simply says, “number two", before
he begins to hold his mental impression for 10
seconds. The second card drawn is then placed
face down on top of the preceding card. The third
card is drawn and its number (three)announced,
and the visual image of the symbol is again held
for 10 seconds. The third card is then placed face
down on the two preceding cards. This procedure
continues until the sender has announced number
25 and the subject has recorded his impression.
Then the sender turns over the newly formed stack
and states aloud the actual appearance of the symbols-for example, number one, square; number
two, circle -while the subject records this order in
his Card column. Again after four runs the number
of hits in each run is added and performance
gauged according to the statistical information
given above. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the first two exercises clairvoyance alone is
being tested, since no one has seen the actual order
of the symbols in the deck.In the third exercise
telepathy or clairvoyance may be responsible for
hits above chance, since the sender is holding a
mental image of the symbol as it appears on the
card.&nbsp;<br>

              <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Techniques to Facilitate Clairvoyance <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and Telepathy with ESP Cards.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Breath technique is extremely important.
Subjects should inhale a deep breath, extending
the diaphragm, and visualize the breath's traveling
to the area of the pineal gland (on the forehead
between and just above the eyebrows). This breath
technique should be repeated three times before a
subject attempts to record any impressions. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Some subjects may find it helpful to close
their eyes and visualize a projection screen. Then
the symbol would appear on the screen. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. It can be beneficial to gaze at the deck and,
in the first exercise, to mentally extend one's sight
to actually pass through the cards and see or feel
the images on their faces. In the first exercise the
sight is extended one card at a time, after the impression of the previous card has been recorded.
The same technique may be used in the second
exercise, but here it is necessary to extend the
sight through only one card at a time. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the third exercise both sender and subject
perform the preliminary breathing exercises. The
sender takes an additional deep breath each time
he draws a card from the deck and holds its mental
image in his mind. The subject then may be aided
by visualizing the image of the symbol as actually
falling into his head. A helpful technique in distinguishing among the five symbols is the use of
extended sensory perception to be aware of the
feeling each symbol imparts. Squares tend to feel
heavy;circles tend to feel light; stars tend to feel
sharp or pointed; wavy lines convey the feeling of
movement; plus signs convey a combination of
sharpness with empty space. With practice the
subject will become aware of how each symbol
mentally feels to him; then his number of hits
above chance will increase greatly. Extended sensory perception is the key here as in all&nbsp; clairvoyant, telepathic, and psychometric techniques.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp; ESP WITH REGULAR PLAYING
CARDS.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; From a regular deck of playing cards the four
aces are removed and placed side by side across
the top of the table. The subject shuffles the remaining 48 cards and then cuts the deck 3 times
with a metal edge. Then he selects the top card and
places it to one side of the deck, face down. Using
the techniques of extended sensory perception he
attempts to place this card by suit on the proper
ace; for example, if his impression is that the card
is a diamond he places the card face down under
the ace of diamonds, forming a column as he adds
cards. This procedure is continued, a card at a
time, until the subject has matched all 48 cards
with their respective aces. Two complete trials or
runs through the deck are necessary to attain statistical significance. When the subject has completed the run by placing the 48 cards in columns,
he then turns the cards over, a column at a time;
for example, all cards under the ace of diamonds
column are turned over and hits recorded as the
number of diamonds actually placed in the
column. Each column is recorded in the same way. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When the numbers of hits in 2 runs have been
recorded they are added together and evaluated
according to the following statistics for 2 runs:
chance score for 2 runs is 96 cards with 24 hits; 32
hits will yield odds of 20 to 1. Hits of 35 and above
yield the odds of 100 to 1 of their occurrence by
chance alone.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp; Techniques to Aid the Subject.<br>
            </span>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The preliminary breathing techniques noted
in the previous exercises also apply here. Through
extended sensory perception the subject can learn
to be aware of the distinct differences in the four
suits. Red has a light, warm feeling. Black has a
heavy, slightly depressing feeling; diamonds and
spades have a sharp feeling when touched through
extended sensory perception. To distinguish between a diamond and a spade one must be aware
of the feeling of lightness or heaviness associated
with the feeling of sharpness. Hearts and clubs
have a rounded or smooth feeling. Again the subject must consider the lightness or heaviness associated with the extended feeling of roundness or
smoothness. With practice the subject will find
that he can become quite proficient at distinguishing a suit of cards face down.&nbsp;<br>

              <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PSYCHOMETRIC CLAIRVOYANCE.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Clairvoyance stimulated through psychometry <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; while holding an object).
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Hold the object between the hands. A
watch or a ring is often the best object for use in
psychometric demonstrations because its association with the subject usually has been of long duration and daily contact. Take three deep breaths,
extending the diaphragm with each and visualizing
the breath concentrated in the pineal gland area
(between and just above the eyebrows). Remember
to relax the stomach muscles after each breath. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Do not look at the subject or get any feedback until the demonstration is completely finished. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Speak your impressions without censorship. (Someone should already have been
designated to record your spoken impressions in
writing;then you can verify them at the conclusion of the demonstration.) It is extremely important that your first impressions, no matter how
silly they may seem to you, be spoken without the
intervention of logical reasoning. When logical
reasoning enters, the state of altered consciousness
associated with clairvoyance leaves. The first impressions you receive may deal with various
senses and may present themselves to you in various ways. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When the free flow of impressions stops,it is
time to mentally extend your senses for specific
information. For example, if a description of the
person's home has not come during the free flow
period of impressions, mentally ask yourself to be
aware of this person's home. Extend your sense of
sight to be aware of architecture, furniture arrangement, color, pictures on the walls, and any unusual object in the room. Speak these impressions
as quickly as they come to you. If the person seems
to have a purple sofa with orange polka dots and
yellow stripes, say it. Do not let yourself reason
that no one in his right mind would own such a
sofa. You may be surprised at how many seemingly ridiculous impressions are validated on
completion of the demonstration. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Next extend other senses to receive specific
information about other questions. The senses of
hearing, taste, smell, and touch may be extended
exactly as was the sense of sight. For example, if
you want to know what the subject's favorite food
is you should mentally ask yourself the question,
extending your sense of smell and taste to obtain
the desired information. You may experience a
very salty or a very sweet or sour taste in your
mouth. You may also find that associated with the
salty taste in your mouth is the feeling of something brittle on your tongue. The impression
formed from these sensations may be that the subject delights in potato chips. If you find it difficult
to imagine anyone's delight in potato chips you
again should not allow logical reasoning or personal preference to enter the situation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. You may want information about a specific
period in the subject's life. For example, although
you are an adult you may want information specific to the subject during his eighth year of life. In
this situation extend your senses through time,
remembering that whatever has been is never
completely lost. Ask yourself mentally what specific events had particular impact for the subject at
age eight. A free flow period of impressions may
follow this mental question. Relate this information as it occurs. Now ask yourself mentally to be
aware of the subject's home during his eight years.
Extend all the senses as above. This technique of
mental questioning for specific information can be
carried on indefinitely. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Past medical history often is a valuable
area in which to demonstrate the specificity of this
technique. Mentally ask yourself for information
about the subject's physical, emotional, and
mental state as it was in the past and as it exists
now. Free flow information will follow. Then you
may want to ask the mental question: “Does this
person have any scars or identifiable marks that
are covered by garments?" If you want medical
information from a particular period of life you
need only ask the mental question: “What was this
person's physical, emotional, and mental state
during his 21st year.” <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. As should be evident by now, information
may be as detailed and specific as you desire
simply by asking delineated mental questions of
yourself and extending your senses in order to be
aware of the answers. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost every human being at some time has
experienced spontaneous telepathy. The incident
may have involved two people who spoke identical words at the same moment. Or a person may
have thought about someone, received a telephone
call, and found that the caller was the very party
being thought about. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The idea that one mind can communicate
with another mind or, indeed. with many minds
simultaneously has enchanted and mystified man
since the beginning of reported history. Creative
writers, writers of science fiction. and poets often
have used as a theme the ideal form of communication, mind-to-mind contact, without a word
spoken. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Science has explored the idea of telepathy
with the aid of modern scientific instruments such
as the electroencephalograph. The Russians have
succeeded in demonstrating telepathy between
two people, one in Moscow and the other in Leningrad. Scientists in Russia also have been able to
Show by means of the electroencephalograph the
exact moment a telepathic communication leaves
the sender and the exact moment it enters the
mind of the receiver. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; What telepathy has to offer mankind is the
possibility that one day the deaf and the mute may
be able to communicate telepathically. For those
who are able to speak their thoughts and hear
spoken communications telepathy offers the possibility of an open line of communication in times
of emergency as well as in everyday life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The effectiveness of involving the senses in
telepathic communication has been proven over a
two-year period in classes and experimentation
conducted at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
Georgia. Various techniques were used to evaluate
learning conditions conducive to both sending
and receiving telepathic communication. These
techniques began with the sender's merely
sending a word, a book title, or a playing card from
an ordinary deck of 52 cards, and gradually involved the senses in sequential order. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, beginning experiments merely
required that the sender concentrate on the word
flower. Then the sender not only attempted to
communicate the word flower, but also to include
a specific image of a red rose. The addition of the
red rose image to the thought of the word flower
was found to be more readily received. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; As each new sense was involved in the message to be communicated, accuracy of reception
increased phenomenally. The end product, a message sent telepathically, using each of the ordinarily accepted senses, might be as follows. The
sender, wanting to convey the mental image of a
flower to one or more subjects, would envision a
red rose so that it could be clearly seen in the
mind’s eye. He would add to this the fragrance
associated with roses in full bloom, then would
mentally run his hand very lightly over the
blossom so as to include in his mental image the
softness and the thorns associated with roses. In
order to involve the senses of hearing and taste the
sender would mentally recall the sound of bees
hovering above a garden of roses and would mentally touch a rose petal to his tongue. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Full use of all the senses energizes a telepathic
message, and it finds its way to the receiver telepathically through five doors simultaneously. The
greater the bombardment and involvement of the
senses with which the receiver is well acquainted,
the greater is the accuracy of the receiver in telepathic reception. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Telepathic experiments have not been con-
fined to human subjects. Dr. Karlis Osis worked
extensively with telepathy in cats, and one of Dr. I.
B. Rhine's first research endeavors in parapsychology involved a horse who was alleged to have
telepathic ability. Interestingly, Dr. Rhine and his
associates could find no logical explanation for the
way the animal followed mental commands, and
they were left with telepathy as the sole means of
interpreting the animal’s behavior. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the reader has already learned that the
brain works on electrical impulses, the idea that
thought is actually patterned energy should not be
too difficult to accept. The human mind seems
capable of sending thought over a great distance or
to someone in the same room. Here it must be kept
in mind that to validate telepathic communication
one must be able to rule out the possibility of any
ordinary sensory cues. Insistence on a strict scientific framework cannot be overemphasized. All
telepathic experiments must be prefaced with
practical means of excluding any possibility of
communication other than that of mind to mind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In telepathy as in clairvoyance and psychometry it is important that the reader realize he is
doing no more than extending his normally accepted senses. In fact, when sending a telepathic
message the more the sender is able to involve his
senses in the thought he wants to communicate,
the easier it will be for the receiver to pick up and
interpret the message. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. This exercise can involve two or any
number of people. The person selected as sender
takes the receivers on an imaginary trip. He states
aloud, “I am going to take you on a shopping trip,"
or “I'm going to take you to a place that means a
great deal to me." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The sender then speaks a line, leaving a blank
statement for the receivers to fill in on receipt of a
telepathic message. For example, “I am going into
a certain type store. As I enter the storel am particularly aware of the fragrance that seems to permeate the surroundings. I am going to experience
this fragrance and communicate it to you. Extend
your senses with me and write down with no
communication among you the fragrance you feel
I am attempting to convey to you.” “I am now
walking through the store. My eye is caught by a
particular article; the color impresses me and I
touch the article. I will now communicate to you
through thought the color and texture I am experiencing." “Extend your sight and sense of touch
and share in my experience. As before, with no
communication among yourselves, write down
your impressions.” <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This exercise may be continued to include 10
separate experiences in the imaginary journey. In
each experience the reader should attempt to involve as many of the senses as possible. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. This exercise also can involve two or any
number of persons. They can be in the same room
or can be physically removed from the sender by
any distance. The exercise involves telepathic
communication of a drawing or sketch, which the
receiver is to duplicate. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Simple geometric figures may be used at first.
Easy items, such as a cup and saucer or a house,
also may be used. The idea here is for the receiver
to duplicate as closely as possible the sketch that
the sender is drawing and communicating. As
greater proficiency is developed more detailed
drawings may be used. For example, instead of
using a simplified picture of a house the sender
may put in a certain number of windows, trees
surrounding the house, or a specific kind of door
on the house. The experiment‘s success again will
be determined by how closely the receiver‘s sketch
resembles the sender’s original sketch. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. This exercise involves the use of a deck of
ordinary playing cards. Once the deck has been
shuffled and cut the sender takes the top card and
attempts to convey to his receiver or receivers the
number and suit of the selected card. Again the
senses must be brought into play. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Through experimentation it has been found
that people perceive the color red as weighing less
than black. Thus the receiver could distinguish
between the two colors by allowing himself to be
aware of lightness or heaviness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In determining the suit of the card it has been
shown that hearts and clubs are experienced as
rounded objects. A heart may be distinguished
from a club by the degree of heaviness involved
with the round shape. Diamonds and spades are
experienced as pointed objects, a feeling of sharpness. Here again the degree of heaviness involved
allows the receiver to distinguish the suit. Face
cards are experienced as crowded patterns, a
feeling of fullness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Once the receiver has determined that a face
card is involved he need only return to the beforementioned exercise for distinguishing the suit. It is
suggested that this exercise be done with all 52
cards. If the participants do not have time to run
through the entire deck, the deck should be placed
aside in two stacks—one stack for the cards already sent and placed in the order of their appearance, the other stack for unsent cards, which is
placed aside without disturbing the order of the
cards or looking at the cards to ascertain their
order in the deck. Verification of the telepathic
communication can not take place until the entire
deck of 52 cards has been sent. Completion allows
the statistics for any exact hit (king of hearts) to
remain 1 in 52 and for 2 or more hits to be calculated easily from this base of chance expectation. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The human aura is a highly charged magnetic
ﬁeld that surrounds and permeates the human
body. Although one can learn to see the aura
within 5 or 10 minutes, most people are unaware
of its existence, possibly because of functional
blindness. People often see selectively in looking
at an object; so they may be unaware of much of
the detail in the object because they have attended
only to certain features. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Much research related to the human aura has
been done. Dr. Walter I. Kilner, physician at St.
Thomas Hospital in London, did the first known
scientific experiments in determining by laboratory means the nature of the aura. These experiments were begun in 1908, when Dr. Kilner first
noticed a haze around the human body. He became interested in exploring the possibility that
this haze or aura might reflect a person’s physiological state, and he did, in fact, find that particular colors and patterns in the aura accompanied
certain diseases in the body. In 1920 Dr. Kilner
published his book, Human Atmosphere, which
was followed by Human Aura. It was Dr. Kilner‘s
opinion that 95 out of 100 people with unaided
vision could be trained to see and interpret the
aura. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In Russia a form of photography, the Kirlian
method, has made it possible for scientists to photograph and evaluate the magnetic field that surrounds all living human beings. Recently at Stanford University American scientists have
duplicated the Russian feat by photographing the
human aura in color. Another researcher at Cornell, Dr. Otto Rahn, discovered after extensive research that the strongest human radiations emanate from the fingertips of the right hand. This
finding has long been known to persons involved
in psychic healing. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Evidence that the aura has been seen for centuries, although its exact nature was not known,
can be found in religious paintings that depict
halos around the bodies of saints and prophets.
Thanks to the efforts of many researchers we are
now able to make specific, verifiable statements
about the human aura. The magnetic field that
immediately surrounds the body and extends
about one-eighth inch around all portions of the
body, including the hair, usually is referred to as
the etheric or bioplasrnic body. This narrow band is sensitive to touch, and one can learn with little
difficulty to be aware of its existence. Several researchers have found that this inner aura will respond to a magnet; it can be attracted to a magnet,
but is not itself a magnet. So the aura does have
mass, probably because of the presence of iron particles. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The aura extends farther around such projections as the nipples and the fingers than it does
from flatter surfaces. It is interesting to note here
that this state is also true of an electrically charged
conductor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists in Russia, the United States, and
England have found that it is possible to impart a
beneficial thought, perhaps a slight charge of electrical energy, by means of the aura. The brighter a
person's aura, the stronger the electrical charge he
is able to convey to another. Using breath techniques an individual may learn to increase the
energy in the aura and to direct it at will through
and to a given point. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When one first becomes aware of the aura one
possibly may not at the same time become aware
of its various colors and patterns. The ability to see
colors and patterns in the aura seems with many
people to be a function of time and practice; others
see color immediately; still others report awareness of the rainbow of light since childhood. Although the field of color interpretation related to
the aura still needs much investigation and reﬁnement, several statements can be made in regard to
the relationship between the presence of certain
colors and a person's physiological, emotional,
and mental state. Most of the evidence gathered to
date has been empirical; the area itself is open to
much deeper investigation in the interpretation of
particular shades and hues. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Some general interpretations for particular
colors in the aura are the following. Red usually
represents vitality and energy. It has been found
experimentally that when a person becomes angry,
red dominates the auric field. Blue correlates most
often with philosophic pursuits. Much study still
remains to be done in regard to speciﬁc shades of
blue. Yellow correlates with such mental activity
as logical reasoning and critical analysis. Black
has been found to correlate with moods of malice,
hatred, and severe depression. The color white
requires considerably more investigation. Yogis
and other occultists consider it to be indicative of
a highly evolved being, such as a master or guru.
Splotches of brown have been found around and
near diseased organs, and gray seems to correlate
with negative emotions such as fear, mild depression, and a generally negative attitude. Limey yellowish-green has been found to correlate with
deceit. A restful, deep green often is seen around
people who have a great love for the out-of-doors.
The student must remember that much remains to
be discovered about color and pattern in the
human aura and how it relates to the human being
in everyday life. <br>

wander around the head and the rest of the body. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. To enhance the energy in the aura the subject should be instructed to take a deep breath,
being sure to extend the diaphragm as the breath is
taken. The subject then should imagine and will
the inhaled breath to the very top of the head.
During this process the subject should relax the
stomach muscles. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. When the subject has taken the breath and
willed it to the top of his head, viewers should
concentrate their sight on the area of the head and
particularly the crown of the head. The aura
usually is seen as a fluctuating light mist or haze
(i.e., many people describe the aura’s appearance
as similar to heat waves that rise from the ground
on a very hot day). <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. To further confirm that the energy pull in
the aura can be controlled, while the viewers are
concentrating on the crown of the head the subject
should take another deep breath and again direct
this breath to the scalp area. The viewers then
should be able to see the increase in the brightness
of the aura and to be aware of its fluctuation under
the control of the will. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. The subject should now extend his hand,
palm facing the viewers, fingers pointed toward
the ceiling. A deep breath should be taken as before, but this time the subject should imagine the
breath concentrated in the hand. Viewers are instructed to be aware of the aura and its fluctuation,
particularly at the fingertips. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Staring is not necessary and not encouraged. If a viewer has any doubt about what he is
observing he should avert his eyes for a moment
and then look again at the subject. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 9. The ability to see colors in the auric field
may be immediately present in a viewer or may be
developed with practice. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 10. An easy experiment to give evidence that
the aura has mass can be performed with the assistance of a large magnet. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 11. A person should be selected to stand near
the subject, holding the magnet in his hand. The
magnet should be held approximately one and a
half to two feet from the subject’s body. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 12. The subject again takes a deep breath, and
the viewers should pay particular attention to the
area where the magnet is held. The aura will run to
the magnet.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Select a room with a mirror opposite a neutral wall. The bathroom in most houses or apartments works very well for this purpose. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Turn off the light in the room being used
for the experiment, making sure that a light outside the room emits enough light so that you can
distinguish your own features in the mirror. <br> 3. Take a deep breath and imagine the breath
filling the head. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. You should be quickly aware of the aura in
the head area. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. An additional breath may be taken and
again directed to the head to increase the intensity
of the auric field and make its fluctuations more
pronounced. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. As in viewing the aura of others, your own
aura will appear as a light mist or haze. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Color discrimination of the aura may be
possible immediately or will develop with practice. <br>

            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The subject for the exercise should increase
the energy in the aura through breath techniques
described earlier. Those who take part in the exercise should stand directly in front of the subject,
one person at a time, and place their hands approximately six inches from either side of the subject’s head. The participant should then close his
eyes and allow himself to place all awareness in
his hands. The subject then takes another deep
breath from the diaphragm and mentally envisions
the breath filling and leaving his head. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The participant probably will experience the
sensation of heat and the feeling of movement
around his hands. This technique has proven very
successful in allowing the blind to experience the
human aura.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When the subject has placed himself before a
neutral wall and raised the level of energy in his
aura through breathing, as previously described,
the participants place a large horseshoe magnet
approximately four inches on either side of the
subject's head. Participants will find that placing a
magnet in this position while viewing the aura
creates an interesting effect. The inner aura will
run to or extend to meet the magnet. The magnet
can be placed the same distance from the body in
any other area, and the same effect will be
achieved. This experiment indicates that the aura
does possess mass and can be used as a valuable
example in answer to the question of afteri magery. <br>

            <br>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychokinesis.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the areas encompassed by parapsychology, psychokinesis is perhaps the most fascinating
and promising area of human potential. Psychokinesis, usually referred to as PK, describes the concept that the mind actually can exert an effect on
material objects external to itself. PK has been
used experimentally to control the roll of dice and
to inhibit growth in cultures of plant diseases. It
also has been used to accelerate plant growth and
to bring anesthetized mice back to consciousness
long before the effects of the anesthetic normally
would disappear. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The idea that the mind can traverse space and
actually make its effects felt by material objects
may at first seem astounding. However, scientists
are no longer attempting to prove the possibility of
such an occurrence but, instead, are looking for
practical applications for a phenomenon already
experimentally proven. Research conducted in the
Soviet Union by Dr. Pavel Naumov and in the
United States by Dr. I. B. Rhine and Dr. Louisa E.
Rhine has shown beyond doubt that PK-the
ability of the mind to affect material objects-is a
reality. Most of the Rhines’s subjects did not consider that they could control external events with
the sheer force of mind, but most of them showed
marked ability in psychokinesis. All subjects evidenced PK ability in varying degrees. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The question of what force or energy is responsible for the PK effect naturally confronts the
logical mind. Although no pat answers are available now, several theories have been set forth both
in Russia and in the United States. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; After studying Mikailova and others trained to
develop this latent talent, Soviet scientists proposed the theory that psychokinesis involves the
conversion of physical energy into psychic energy,
which is then converted to kinetic energy, which
leaves the subject and exerts its force on material
objects. A major reason for this conclusion is that
Mikailova and others lose three to four pounds
during an experimental session. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; J. B. Rhine has theorized that PK has its basis
in the relationship between mind and body. He
considers that energy must be used to direct energy; therefore PK begins with the use of direct
nervous energy, and nervous energy converts itself
to muscular energy. This muscular, or kinetic,
energy then directs the movement of material objects. The key to understanding Rhine's approach
is to realize that for him the mind is not imprisoned in the physical body but can traverse space
and perhaps even time itself. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The important fact to keep in mind is that PK
can be studied and measured scientifically. One
must also keep in mind that PK is a form of energy
that requires considerably more research. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The practical uses to which PK may be put are
numerous and varied. A nation that develops in its
citizens the ability to deflect the needle of a compass across vast distances in space may gain a strategic weapon. The compass of a ship at sea, the
compass of a plane in the air, or the compass of a
unit in the field could be deflected by the power of
thought alone. Experimentation has shown that
PK also can be used to disorient a gyroscope—the
mechanism that guides intercontinental ballistic
missiles. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychokinesis surely will have a marked effect on biology and physics. Biologists traditionally have considered physical effects to be the
product of physical causes. PK experiments have
shown that it is possible to use the mind to control
the rate of the heartbeat—indeed, even to stop the
heartbeat—to control the blood pressure, and to
impede or accelerate plant growth depending on
the will of the person who conveys psychokinetic
energy. Biology as a science cannot long ignore
experiments that so markedly affect it. Since
physics as a science deals with energy, psychokinesis naturally falls in its realm. Physicists
well may have to answer the parapsychologist's
question: “What is the nature of psychokinetic
energy?” <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter from what discipline comes the
answer to this question, the experiments that led
to the question cannot and must not be ignored.
Discovery of the nature of psychokinesis and laws
that govern it may hold the answer to the much
talked about energy depletion of the future. <br>

            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Begin by using a pair of dice. After several
hours oi practice more dice may be added to reduce the number of tosses necessary to obtain statistically significant results. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Perform the breath exercises outlined in
Chapter 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. It is important to have in your mind a clear
picture of the face of the die you want to be uppermost when the dice come to rest. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Begin by choosing a number from 1 to 6.
For the purpose of illustration we will use the
number 3 in discussing this exercise. The dice
should be thrown from a cup rather than from the
palm of the hand. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Keeping the chosen number in mind, take a
deep breath, imagine the dice to have already
fallen with the desired number on the upturned
faces, and throw the dice from the cup. A backboard should be used and the dice thrown so that
they hit and rebound from its surface. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. With two dice a total of six runs is suggested to ascertain statistical significance above
mean chance expectation. Each run should consist
of six tosses of the two dice, since the mean chance
expectation for any number of tosses is one-sixth
of the total dice thrown by chance alone. In 6 runs
of 6 tosses each, chance alone would produce 12
hits. Therefore, 17 hits would yield odds of 20 to 1;
18 hits would produce odds of 100 to 1. That is,
chance would account for this number of hits only
1 time in 100 trials. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. The following statistics are given for the
use of two dice, six tosses in each trial. In 12 runs
mean chance expectation is 24 hits; 30 hits give
odds of 20 to 1, and 32 hits odds of 100 to 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. You may reduce the number of runs necessary for statistical significance by tossing six dice
simultaneously. In this instance 10 runs, each
consisting of 24 tosses, are needed. Since the total
number of tosses equals 240, mean chance expectation would be 40 hits or one-sixth of the total
number of tosses thrown. <br>

              <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; DIVERTING THE NEEDLE ON A <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; COMPASS THROUGH PK.<br>
            </span>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The compass need not be expensive but
should be one of accepted reliability. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Perform the breath exercises described in
Chapter 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Place the compass on a flat surface before
you, all other objects in the immediate area removed. Be sure that the compass is placed so that
it faces true north and that the needle is not flucmating. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Take another breath. Will the circulation of
the breath as previously described. Direct the
breath to the fingertips and eyes. Imagine the fingers becoming elongated through the projection of
energy leaving through your ﬁngertips. Place the
hands above the compass, willing the energy of the
breath through the hands as if to actually push the
needle in the desired direction by means of the
energy extending through the fingers. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Visualize this same energy leaving through
the eyes. Imagine it as two beams of light that extend from your eyes, make contact with the needle
on the compass, and push it in the desired direction. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Use your imagination and will to portray in
your own mind the actual results you want to
achieve. In your own mind see the needle move
and accept the fact as already accomplished. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Concentrate on the beams of energy leaving
your fingers and eyes, pushing the needle in a desired direction of change. You may find it helpful
at ﬁrst to move the hands back and forth above the
compass, thereby allowing the energy to gain
momentum as the energy field around the compass itself is disrupted by the PK energy being introduced into it. Most often the needle at first will
sway east and west in a small arc, which will increase as you repeat the breathing exercises and
the extension of energy to the needle. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Once this arc movement is in progress you
are ready to begin control of the speciﬁc direction
the needle will take. For example, if you want the
needle to move due east 20 degrees bring both
hands above the true north and move them quickly
in an eastward direction, allowing the energy from
your eyes to push the needle, adding extra momentum to its directional movement. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 9. Increasing the degrees of deflection is a
matter of practice, and those who seriously want
to develop this ability will practice a half-hour
each day. Breath exercises, the visualization of
energy, and the strength of the will are the key factors in the purposeful use of psychokinetic energy. <br>

            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Follow the breathing exercises in Chapter 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Select a light object, such as a matchstick
or paper clip, to begin your practice. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Hold the hands above the object as directed
in the previous exercise. The object should be covered with a glass to prevent interference of air currents. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Follow the directions given in the previous
exercises, choosing the direction in which you
want the object to move and directing your energy
to impel the object in that direction. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Again, serious practice must involve at
least a half-hour each day. <br>

            <br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the areas related to parapsychology,
mediumship is the one in which fraudulent practitioners are most frequently found. The validity of
mediumship—that is, a discarnate entity, communicating with living beings through a living person
called a medium_has been in question since recorded history. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Death itself is an unknown. The question of
survival, after death, of the soul or personality can
be found in every culture from the cave to the
present. The Greek Oracle of Delphi is spoken of
historically as a high priestess with the power to
act as a bridge between this world and the next.
Kings and nation-states consulted her on such
matters as battle strategy, weather prediction, and
the welfare of departed spirits. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One might consider that man has come a long
way since the time of the Oracle of Delphi, but it is
interesting to note that an archaic English law that
pronounced all mediums and witches vagrants
was not repealed until 1951. The passage of time
has done very little to dissuade humans from
seeking means of communicating with the dead.
The reader may be surprised to discover on investigation that throughout history persons who have
led in their fields and have been considered extremely intelligent not only have believed such
communication possible but also have attempted
to demonstrate its possibility. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas A. Edison was one such pioneer. At
73 Edison was interviewed by the Scientific American on his work in the construction of a machine
that would allow the living to communicate with
the dead. In the October 30, 1920, edition of the
Scientific American Edison gave his views on the
possibilities of life after death and spoke of his
work on communication with deceased persons.
At about the same time American Magazine (October 20, 1920) contained the article, “Edison
Working to Communicate with the Next World."
Any reader who holds the opinion that to embrace
a belief in mediumship shows a lack of intelligence need only ask himself whether the man who
invented the phonograph and the alkaline battery
could be considered unintelligent. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Emanuel Swedenborg, well-known scientist
and philospher in the 17th and 18th centuries, was
an enthusiastic supporter of the theory of life after
death and of the possibility of communication
with the dead. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries such people as Arthur Schopenhauer and
Immanuel Kant addressed themselves to the question of soul survival and communication with the
next world. Kant, best known for Critique Of Pure
Reason, published in 1781, also wrote a book little
referred to in philosophy classes today. The book,
Dreams of a Ghost Seer, published in 1776, was
concerned mainly with Swedenborg’s work in
mediumship. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; William McDougall wrote Body and Mind in
1911. The book was a plea bordering on a demand
that science investigate the possible survival of the
human personality after death. McDougall taught
at Oxford and Harvard and later held a position at
Duke University, where in 1927 he engaged Doctors J. B. Rhine and Louisa E. Rhine to set up the
parapsychology laboratory to research the psychic
field, including mediumship. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The well-known psychologist Carl G. Jung
also expounded the belief that the human personality survives bodily death. Iung, whose works are
studied today in colleges and universities, reported that he had conversed with discarnate
spirits and felt that a particular discarnate acted as
his guide in times of stress. Interestingly, Jung's
work and beliefs in such areas are rarely, if ever,
referred to in psychology classes. How is it possible for this discipline to place such great emphasis on his contributions to psychology and yet
completely ignore the time and energy he devoted
to parapsychology? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Add to this list of recognized geniuses the
name of Socrates, who also conversed with disembodied spirits, and the logical conclusion is that
extremely intelligent and creative men have considered communication with the dead possible
and have pleaded and demanded that science take
an active part in the investigation of soul survival
and communication after death. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The average person usually is not aware that
mediumship is manifested in many different
forms. The most common conception of mediumship, and the form most often used in television
and movies, is physical mediumship, which is
characterized by the production of such physical
phenomena as rushing winds, table levitation,
sounds, lights, and general physical disturbances—all reported to be manifestations of disembodied
spirits. Of all the forms of mediumship, this one is
most open to fraud and trickery. Certainly it would
not be difficult for an unscrupulous person to produce such physical phenomena by very ordinary
though underhanded methods. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Television and movies also have portrayed
direct voice mediumship. In this form the discarnate spirit is supposed to actually speak through
the medium so that those present who knew the
discarnate before his death are able to recognize
the voice of their deceased friend or relative. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A slightly less dramatic form is called mental
mediumship. In this form the medium supposedly
sees and hears the deceased spirits and conveys
the messages in her own voice but with the recognized speech patterns and idiosyncrasies of the
discarnate spirit. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Trumpets announce yet another form, called
trumpet mediumship. In this manifestation messages from departed friends and loved ones are
announced through a trumpet, which materializes
in a mysterious manner and floats about the room
in midair while messages are announced to those
present. Apparently, though, the flight of the
trumpet medium’s instrument is aided by very
material attached strings. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most interesting forms of mediumship is that in which the medium produces from
her body ectoplasm that materializes into a supposed discrete image of the departed individual. It
is unfortunate that in such materialization mediumship the medium removes himself from the
view of all present and takes up residence in a cabinet! The reason given is that as the ectoplasm
leaves the body in such great quantities the physical body becomes withered and extremely grotesque. We know of no scientific experimentation
to support such reasoning. Even when psychic
experimenters expressed a willingness to risk the
gruesome sight, the mediums felt compelled to
protect them from foolhardiness by denying them
visual access to the cabinet while the séance was
in progress. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever a medium ﬁnds it necessary to exclude herself from the sitters’ visual field, the sitters have reason to become more than a little suspicious. It cannot be stressed too often that any
form of mediumship must be seen through open
though extremely skeptical eyes. It is far too easy
for a bereaved relative or friend to see and hear
only what he wants to be the truth; so one must
look very carefully, not only at the subject of mediumship but also at the individual medium. This is
not to say that all mediums are deliberately fraudulent but only to warn those who would seek out
mediums that ethical and nonethical persons exist
in every ﬁeld, including mediumship. Since we
have turned our attention to the medium as an individual, let us consider several characteristics
that mediums seem to share almost universally. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; First, a medium rarely performs effectively in
the presence of an antagonistic and closed-minded
skeptic. Unfortunately, this characteristic inhibits
scientific investigation. Certainly not all scientists
are antagonistic or closed-minded, for to consider
spending time in such investigation is a mark,
hopefully, of some openness on the investigator’s
part. Add that a very important ingredient in the
makeup of any scientist worthy of the name is an
open-minded and open-ended approach to any
field in which he wants to do research. Nevertheless, investigators and ordinary sitters alike frequently can unwittingly bring prejudice and antagonism into a research situation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A possible explanation for such disruption in
the medium's efficient performance can be found
in consideration of vibratory fields and energy patterns. Mediums throughout history have said that
work in mediumship requires vast amounts of
energy. Whenever extremely negative conditions
are present the medium must deploy energy to
overcome the negativity before getting down to the
business of communication with the next world.
Whether this is an adequate explanation is left to
the reader; however, except in fraudulent situations, all endeavors require energy. If that energy
must be divided, then surely it is possible that
energy will be lessened in the performance of the
major task at hand. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The second universal characteristic of mediums is that ability to perform fluctuates from
month to month, day to day, and even hour to
hour. As is true of most abilities, the faculty to perform as a mediumistic channel is not constant,
which may explain why some people who possess
valid capability to communicate with another
world turn to fraudulent practices. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, imagine if you will a medium
who has an opportunity to conduct a séance in the
presence of people who can be influential in
aiding his career. Imagine that in the presence of
these people the medium discovers that on this
day her ability just happens to have fluctuated on
the downside of his effective and impressive performance. What does the medium do? Too often,
believing that he is facing a one-time chance, he
stoops to fraud, hoping those present will not detect it, and rationalizing in his own mind, “I know
I have a real ability, and this may be my only
chance to convince these people. I’ll cheat now,
but never again!" <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The medium may be more right than he
knows. He may never have the chance again! If an
investigator discovers fraud he has no choice but
to report the facts as they are, and the facts in such
a case can have a long-term damaging effect. The
investigator himself may decide that true research
in the field is impossible, since it is evident that a
person of reputed integrity has compromised himself. The medium, who up until this time may
have been completely honest and enjoyed a reputation for openness and integrity, can easily find
that all the good that preceded is now washed
away like so many soapsuds down a drain. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter how the medium rationalizes the
fraudulent performance, he will never find an
adequate reason for compromising himself and
selling out to his own ego. How much more simple
would it be if in such circumstances he could just
honestly say, “I'm sorry, but for various reasons I
cannot operate as a mediumistic channel at this
time. I welcome your presence and investigation
on another day.” The damage that could be prevented by such a simple and open statement is
unfathomable. Science needs this type of honesty
in mediumship if research is ever to come to
sound scientific conclusions. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The last characteristic we shall consider is the
medium’s inability to use his talents to enhance
his own economic status. We refer here not to an
economic status that may prosper through client
fees but to economic status enhanced by means of
investments based on precognitive knowledge direct from the spirit world. Many mediums and
psychics believe that the use of precognitive information to enhance one’s own financial situation
would result in the loss of all ability to attain such
information—a belief that has no basis in logic.
The true explanation of such a loss of abilities may
more likely be found in that an individual obsessed with amassing a fortune may have no time
to devote to the continual enrichment of psychic
abilities. Precognitive information most generally
is obtained in what may be considered an altered
state of consciousness, or a state of enriched
awareness. One who is preoccupied with materialistic gains probably will spend most of his time
out of such states. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader's attention is directed now to four
theories that attempt to explain the phenomenon
of mediumship. Once again the conclusion on
which theory accurately explains the mediurnistic
process must be left to the reader, for much research remains to be done in this area. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The first theory we will consider is that information conveyed through a medium is received
telepathically from living beings. This telepathy
would be no small feat in itself, but since we are
examining the phenomenon of mediumship, telepathic experience would not lend evidence for
survival after bodily death. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the most interesting point in support
of communication with discarnate spirits is that
many messages conveyed through mediums are
not immediately recognized as valid by those to
whom they are conveyed. Research often has
borne out the accuracy of a mediumistic message,
even though living persons previously associated
with the discarnate cannot validate the message. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The second theory is that the medium is able
to tap universal mind. This theory has its roots in
the ancient belief that there exists a universal
ether, known in occult circles as the Akashic records. These records supposedly contain the complete history of a cycle of creation. If such records
do, in fact, exist, then a medium or other sensitive
possibly could attune himself by altering his state
of consciousness to the vibrational level on which
these records are kept, and it would be much more
difficult to prove through mediumistic methods
the existence of life after death. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Carl Jung spoke of the collective unconscious—a state or level of consciousness—in which
mankind shares access to vast amounts of information and knowledge. Again it must be stated that
much more research must be conducted in order to
gain scientific evidence for the existence of universal mind or soul survival. It is important to
keep in mind that the existence of a universal intelligence would not necessarily rule out the possibility of communication with discarnate spirits.
It would become but one more variable to be seriously considered in mediumistic investigation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychologically, the third theory that attempts
to explain mediumship is one of the most interesting yet proposed. The theory states that the
medium’s messages are a product of his own subconscious mind. This idea, together with the possibility of a splinter personality that the medium is
not consciously aware of, creates an intriguing
psychological problem. It is quite possible, most
likely true, that in many cases this theory can explain mediumistic messages. Psychological journals are replete with studies of split personality. A
less frequent occurrence, but one that must be
considered, is the multiple personality. Most
people are at least acquainted in some way with
The Three Faces of Eve. Certainly the possibility
of a splinter personality in mediumship must be
considered. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Physiological tests in combination with psychological testing may prove the researcher’s most
valuable tool in attempting to determine whether
mediumistic conveyances are the product of the
medium’s subconscious mind. It is enough to say
at this time that physiological differences have
been substantiated scientiﬁcally in the study of
several mediums. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Eileen I. Garrett, a world-famous medium and
researcher, has allowed open scientific investigation of her mediumistic abilities. Definite physiological changes occurred in Mrs. Garrett's bodily
functions when supposed discarnates reportedly
were communicating with her. These changes
involved wide discrepancies in respiration, pulse
rate, electrocardiograph readings, blood count,
and blood sugar readings with each discarnate
supposedly using Mrs. Garrett as a means of communicating with the living world. Physicians evaluated the findings and determined that no physiological laws now known could explain the wide
variations indicated in the laboratory tests, a point
that must be considered as fairly heavy evidence
on the side of discarnate communication. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The final theory to be considered is that the
medium actually becomes a channel through
which discarnates communicate information from
another world. In evaluating this theory the reader
should think again about each of the other theories. If science can rule out all other ways of conveying mediumistic messages, what is left is a
strong case in favor of survival after bodily death
and a communicative link—the medium—be-
tween these two worlds. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; To conclude, the reader is asked to remember
that truth is not an absolute commodity but is the
sum product of intellectual curiosity, an open
mind, and a willingness to consider alternative
factors. Truth has many different faces, and our
perspective of what is true changes as we move to
view facts from other vantage points. This is not
only the purpose of scientific investigation but is
also an obligation of each individual to himself.
“Seek and you shall find” can be well applied to
formal education and self-education. A closed
mind is a dead mind. If we do not move forward
we surely disintegrate. because nothing known to
science ever remains the same. We must ask quesLions if we are ever to have answers. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We must investigate mediumship if we are
ever to know what is responsible for the phenomenon. The approach to such an investigation advocated here is an open mind and a caution, “Let the
sitter beware!" <br>

            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; “You only live once! Or do you?" For centuries man has pondered the question of reincarnation, the doctrine that holds that man lives not one
life but many lives on earth. Up to the present day
most interest in the doctrine of reincarnation has
been conﬁned to the Eastern hemisphere. Only
within the last 20 years have scientists in the
Western hemisphere seriously researched the
question of the human soul's rebirth into another
carnal body for the purpose of living out another
life not in an after-world but right here on earth.
Even though scientists have only recently begun to
study the subject, belief in and investigation of
reincarnation has been present for centuries, even
in the West. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In considering the theory of reincarnation it is
important to understand that we are not concerned
here with the theory of transmigration of souls,
which holds that souls are reborn on earth in many
forms, ranging from trees to lower animals to man.
Reincarnation is the rebirth of a soul in another
human form only, although the human form itself
may change with each incarnation, so that a soul
in one lifetime may inhabit the body of a female,
and in the next lifetime the body of a male. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The important thing to remember about the
theory of reincarnation is that the soul continues
to inhabit a human body. However, the theory
does allow not only for changes in sex but also for
changes in race; that is, a person may incarnate in
the yellow race in one lifetime, in the black race in
another, the white race or the red race in still other
lifetimes. The theory is based on the belief that
man must experience everything before he can
return to being nothing. This nothing is not a state
of bankruptcy but the only state great enough to
contain everything. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For centuries Yogis and other mystics have
spoken of cycles of creation. In a poetic sense
these cycles may be considered days and nights of
creation. The Christian Bible, along with the holy
books of many religions, holds that all that exists
came out of nothing. Eastern religions have expanded on this idea in referring to a day of creation as a state in which the Unmanifest Creator or
Absolute becomes manifest. ln this process of
manifestation the Absolute puts certain limits on
itself. All manifest creation knows some limitation; it has a beginning and it has an end. Only in
the state of nonmanifestation or nothingness are
no limitations to be found. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Once the process of manifestation has begun,
the process of centering—the return to the unmanifest state—also has begun. These two processes
are different sides of the same coin. Iust as there
can be no coin with one side, so there can be no
beginning of manifestation without the simultaneous beginning of centering—the Absolute
pulling everything back to itself—to return to the
unmanifest state of nothingness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; So, according to the doctrine of reincarnation,
individualized spirit, the soul manifests in the
corporeal body of a human being so that it might
experience and evolve to the point where it can be
brought back to the unit of pure being, nothingness. The words, “the soul is to experience and
evolve,” form another pillar in the foundation of
belief in reincarnation. Those who have taught the
doctrine have stated that the soul is evolving along
spiritual lines, and with each new lifetime the
opportunities needed for its further growth are
presented. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This idea of spiritual evolution, or evolution
of the noncorporeal soul, is analogous to the idea
of physical evolution. We do not intend to speak
here for or against the theory of physical evolution
but only to point out that a belief in spiritual evolution, or the idea of a growth toward perfection, is
not unique to the theory of reincarnation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Hermetic teaching states, “As above so
below." If man does evolve physically—and certainly biologists, geneticists, and physical anthropologists have produced valid evidence to support
this theory—then according to the Hermetic
teaching we also can expect the soul to modify itself through experience as it seeks to achieve the
state of unity with the Absolute from which it
emerged. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; But what of Christianity? Do the historical
documents of the Christian religion contain any
allusions to a doctrine of reincarnation? Let us
examine the principle historical document of
Christianity, the Bible. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider, first, Ecclesiastes 1:9-11: “The
thing that hath been, it is that which shall be and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there
any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It
hath been already of old time, which was before
us. There is no remembrance of former things.”
We shall return later to the last sentence in this
passage, for it bears greatly on a portion of the
foundation for a belief in reincarnation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The concept that a soul inhabiting one body
has previously inhabited the body of a person now
deceased is again alluded to in Matthew 11:11-15:
“Among them that are born of women there hath
not risen a greater than ]oh.n the Baptist. . . . For all
the prophets and the law prophesied until ]ohn:
And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was
for to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear." The prophet Elias had long since departed
the physical earth; yet by Matthew's word Iesus
stated to a multitude that Iohn the Baptist was
indeed Elias. Whether we look at the Bible as an
inspired book or as a historical document this testimony certainly indicates that those who lived in
Christ's time were well acquainted with the idea of
reincarnation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, Christ was thought to be the reincarnation of one of the prophets, as evidenced in Matthrew 16:13~14. “When Iesus came into the coast
of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his Disciples, saying,
Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And
they said, Some say that thou art Iohn the Baptist:
some, Elias; and others, Ieremias, or one of the
prophets.” This response would have given Christ
the perfect opportunity to dismiss as ridiculous
the idea that any man could be the reincarnated
soul of a man who had previously experienced
physical death. Interestingly, the Bible shows no
evidence of Christ's repudiating the belief that
men who walked the earth in his time could possibly be the reincarnated souls of deceased
persons. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the many theories about why the doctrine of reincarnation fell out of favor with the
Christian church is one that postulates that church
and state rulers believed they could more easily
control their subjects if the people believed they
had a one-time chance to attain heaven. (Keep in
mind here that for many centuries church and
state were united.) It is in no way suggested here
that this is the only possible explanation for the
discontinuance of teachings about reincarnation.
Possibly few events—most likely no events-have
one simple explanation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Before beginning a discussion of what facts
science can offer for and against the theory of reincarnation, let us consider the doctrine of Karma,
which is nothing more than the law of cause and
effect. The doctrine states simply that by initiating
certain actions, man sets into motion laws that
carry reactions back to him. Karma does not mean
good or bad but simply speaks of reciprocal returns. Many people believe erroneously that if one
subscribes to the theory of reincarnation he has
license to do anything he wants without fear of
denial of heaven or threat of hell. Careful study of
the doctrine of karma, though, reveals that, rather
than granting license, karma, in fact places on
mankind responsibility for every thought and action. The doctrine clearly states that the soul will
evolve according to the manner in which it decides to act. Here again the Hermetic teaching of
reciprocal returns is reflected in the laws of
physics: every action has an equal and opposite
reaction. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Karma, as no other world doctrine, places on
each individual full responsibility for the exercise
of his own free will. According to this doctrine no
person can safely rationalize any action or even
thought simply by stating, “It wasn't my fault, soand-so made me do it." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader may ask here, “What about circumstances that are not under one ‘s control?” The
responsibility still is left with the individual. Although a person may not always control circumstances, the manner in which he responds to such
circumstances is completely in the realm of free
will and individual choice. A person may feel that
the alternatives open are so unsatisfactory as to
leave no choice, but the fact remains that no matter
how unpleasant alternatives seem they are still
alternatives, and one rather than another can be
selected. The key here is man's free will. He may
try to assuage the pain that ultimate responsibility
can bring, but free will marks him indelibly as responsible for even his smallest actions. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember that Karma is not concerned with
value judgments, or whether a thought or an action
is good or bad. Another way to view Karma is to
see it as a law of opportunity. If our actions and
thoughts are returned to us, then Karma allows
each of us the opportunity to freely choose what
those returns will be. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In Lloyd C. Douglas’s book, Dr. Hudson’s Secret Iournol, Dr. Hudson chooses to receive nonmonetary returns on money loaned to various
people. He tells persons who would repay him to
keep the money but be obliged to pass it along to
someone else if and when they encountered a
person in need. He felt that in this way his gift
would make a full circle and return to him, perhaps not as money but in some manner that would
be beneficial to his life. So the doctrine of Karma
has appeared in Western literature even though
the word Karma has not been applied to the philosophical thought. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Christian Bible contains passages that
allude to the doctrine of Karma. Perhaps one of the
most often quoted passages is Matthew 7:12.
“Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do even so to them: for this
is the law and the prophets." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We have mentioned that in reincarnation a
soul evolves with each life spent on the earth. The
next incarnation of the soul will depend much on
what the soul has learned in the previous life.
Again we find in the Christian Bible a verse that
reflects this belief. In the Apocrypha, The Wisdom
of Solomon 8:19-20, we find the words, “Now I was a child good by nature, and a good soul fell to
my lot. Nay, rather, being good, I came into a body
undefiled." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not our purpose here to fully expound the
doctrines of reincarnation and Karma; that task
would require another book. However, the information given here should acquaint you with these
ideas and allow you an opportunity to decide for
yourself whether you want to research the doctrines more closely. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us now examine the scientific views of
reincarnation. Since intellect and objective evaluation are two of the major tools of scientiﬁc investigation, we may begin by asking what events in
everyday life suggest the possibility that reincarnation is not merely a theory but an actuality. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One possible way of considering reincarnation is through the discipline of physics. A basic
law of physics is the law of conservation of energy,
which holds that energy can be neither created nor
destroyed but is merely transformed from one state
to another. Since all that exists can be reduced to
some form of energy, man, too, can be placed in
this category. Thomas Edison once stated in his
diary, “Life, like matter, is indestructible. There
has always been a certain amount of life in this
world and there will always be the same amount.
You cannot create life; you cannot destroy life; you
cannot multiply life.” This remark aptly illustrates
the first argument in favor of reincarnation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Another possible argument in support of the
validity of the theory of reincarnation has its basis
in the self. Evidence found in human nature expresses man's belief in the indestructibility of the
personality or ego. Can you think of a time when
you did not exist? Do not consider historical
events that occurred before your birth but, rather,
try to conceive of a state of nonexistence of your
own soul or personality. Conceive in your mind, if
you can, the point at which you were not! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Small children frequently provide a further
illustration of this concept. When adults are discussing occurrences in their childhoods children
often ask, “Where was I when you were a child?"
It seems impossible for a child to conceive of the
time when he did not exist! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Child prodigies suggest another argument ih
favor of reincarnation. How is it that some children display great talent in certain fields at a very
early age? Mozart, for example, was able to play
difficult concertos on the piano when he was six
years old. Is it possible that a soul which enters life
on earth brings with it talents developed in a previous lifetime? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly these are arguments and not conclusive evidence to support the theory of reincarnation. However, they have posed enough questions,
to laymen and scientists alike, to initiate research
into the phenomenon. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Much of the research has involved regression
through hypnosis, a technique that has obvious
and subtle drawbacks. First, we do not suggest that
everyone interested in reincarnation become engaged in research through hypnotic regression.
The use of hypnosis is best left to those clinically
or medically qualified. Second, one must consider
whether the person who is conducting such experiments has in any way suggested to the subject that
he is regressing to a specific time and place. If such
suggestions are given even inadvertently, the experimenter may find himself with a beautiful
piece of fiction that portrays life in an earlier period. Great care must be taken to give no suggestions that the subject might use as building blocks
for the foundation of an imaginary lifetime. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In this type of research more than minimal
numbers of problems arise in obtaining speciﬁc
names and dates. The subject will recall either isolated given names or isolated surnames and is
often vague about dates and names of cities or
towns. It is easy to understand that the researcher’s task in this area is difficult. Many times when
specific names and dates are given they refer to a
time prior to recorded history, which makes veriﬁcation all but impossible. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The investigator's work into reincarnation is
not always aided when specific names and dates
given lie within the range of written history. Then
the researcher must rule out any possibility that
the subject may have come on the information
while reading, attending a movie, listening to a
conversation, or engaging in some academic study
that would have covered the area mentioned.
However, careful research into the history of the
time may strongly suggest the validity of the subject’s statements. For example, a subject may recount a life in which he was an ordinary citizen,
with no claims to fame. If the subject also gives
dates and facts about this earlier person’s life, and
his account is proved valid through close research,
the investigator may consider that he has a case
suggestive of reincarnation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In several universities scientists well qualified in the ﬁelds of medicine, psychology, and
physics are conducting research along these lines.
Another line of research simultaneously taking
place attempts to explain veriﬁed information
suggestive of reincarnation by means of the theory
of genetic memory. Scientists who are investigating the possibility that man is born into this life
with racial memories are considering the possibility that our genes convey to our children not
only biological but also memory characterisitics. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Flatworms have been used in several studies
to test this hypothesis. A generation of flatworms
trained to prefer light rather than dark spaces is
killed after evidence of learning has been shown,
and a food product is prepared from the remains.
This food stuff then is fed to a group of flatworms
not trained to prefer lighted areas. The offspring of
this group, with no previous training, have selected lighted rather than dark areas. This experiment to explore the possibility of genetic memory,
however, is no more conclusive at this time than
are thoroughly researched cases suggestive of reincarnation. To arrive at a perspective of truth one
must see clearly from many different vantage
points. The scientist must always be the objective
viewer, systematically researching various possibilities until the best possible explanation is
reached in the process being investigated. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If the reader has access to small children he
can conduct his own research. Small children
often refer to events that would necessarily have
had to occur in a former life if they occurred at all.
Several students at Georgia State University have
related experiences along these lines with their
own children. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One such incident is the case of a student’s
ﬁve-year-old daughter who refused to ride in an
airplane. The child told her mother that she
wanted never to ride in an airplane because previously she had been killed in an airplane crash.
The child was quite emphatic in stating that before
her present life she had died in a fiery plane crash.
Further, the child said this crash occurred when
she was grown up, not a little girl. The child’s
mother was disturbed by the story and feared the
youngster might be experiencing a clairvoyant
impression of her own future. Although such an
impression is possible in the light of many similar
recorded cases it does not seem probable. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Other cases involving such reports from
youngsters include a six-year-old’s tale of a life as
a seaman on a sailing ship, with a vivid description of sailing vessels and a sketchy but impressive
account of navigation. Another child who claimed
to have died of a specific disease recounted symptoms that were medically verified as those that
would accompany the illness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; If the reader finds an opportunity he can take
advantage of the chance for research by writing
down the facts the child relates. He should question the child in an attempt to gain more specific
information, but he must be very careful at all
times not to suggest anything to the child that
could feed the youngster’s imagination. With such
facts in hand the student might research the material at a good reference library, and if the facts involve a foreign country he might contact agents in
that country who could verify or deny the facts. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When the subject of reincarnation is being
considered, students of parapsychology at Georgia
State University most often question earth's increasing population. Where do all the new souls
come from? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A tenet of reincarnation holds that the soul
when sufficiently evolved may choose not only
the time in which it wants to incarnate but also the
specific circumstances into which it will be introduced. Therefore, many souls may delay the beginning of another life on earth until the conditions necessary to their own personal experience
are present. Even though this idea often surprises
students, since it places on them the responsibility
for having chosen their life circumstances, they
are willing to consider it as a possible explanation
for population growth.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We will not deal with astrology here but do
want to point out that astrology as a science has
much evidence to support its validity. If a soul can
choose its moment of incarnation, then according
to the science of astrology the time that contains
an exact set of circumstances for any individual
comes around every 25,000 years. That is, if an astrologer were to cast the natal chart of an individual 25,000 years would pass before that individual would find exactly the same astrological
conditions. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; If the reader feels any reluctance to consider
astrological information he should be aware that
Carl Iung strongly believed that the astrological
moment of birth stamped the individual with an
indelible mark or tendency toward encountering
certain circumstances. Remember, as before, that
man's free will in regard to response to these circumstances is always an intervening factor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the soul resides and what it does between incarnations is a question science cannot
attempt to answer at this time. Yoga and other
mystical religions teach that the soul spends this
time in another dimension or plane of existence.
They propose the existence of many such dimensions or planes, which the soul inhabits according
to its level of spiritual evolvement. These religions
teach that during its habitation of these planes the
soul's function is to consider mistakes made and
experience gained in previous lifetimes, and that
the soul will decide what new experience it wants
in its next incarnation as well as what experiences
will best stimulate and enhance its spiritual
evolvement. As previously stated, no scientific
proof is available for the existence of such way stations between incarnations, nor is there proof
positive that reincarnation is a fact. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is encouraging to realize that scientists are
contributing increasing amounts of time and energy to research in all fields encompassed by
parapsychology, including reincarnation. It is not
for science to judge whether reincarnation is indeed a fact. The purpose of scientific investigation
is to research possibilities and present the evidence to be evaluated in regard to any topic,
whether that evidence supports or disproves the
theory being investigated. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it is a mark of intellectual evolvement
and a new openness of the mind that scientists are
trying to answer questions that only a decade ago
they would not even acknowledge. We can only
hope the spirit of openness that has allowed inroads in fields that promise great benefit and
knowledge to mankind is but a beginning—the
vanguard announcing a new renaissance of human
potential. <br>

            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dermaoptics.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The literal deﬁnition of dermaoptics is skin
sight, but this explanation of the phenomenon is
inadequate. By means of dermaoptics a sighted
person can learn to read through sealed opaque
envelopes and discern the contents of photographs
or written material enclosed in them. The phenomenon also allows an individual to discern
color through touch without actually seeing the
color with the eyes. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Although these acts may sound astounding,
they have indeed occurred. For two years research
and classes have been conducted at Georgia State
University, where the techniques were first inﬂoduced and refined. Students in a psychology
course offered through the School of Special
Studies at Georgia State University not only
learned rather quickly to distinguish the content of
photographs sealed in envelopes but also were
able to report both tactile and emotional sensations that reflected the situation portrayed in the
pictures. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Historically, the concept of dermaoptics is not
new. At conferences on psychology persons reported to have this ability have been introduced.
The Russians also have conducted research with
individuals able to display the phenomenon. One
of the chief differences between dermaoptics as
discussed here and as historically discussed is that
previously it was thought to be a unique gift that
only a few individuals possessed. It will become
clear on reading this chapter that dermaoptics is
not limited to a gifted elite but is an ability contained in human nature itself. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The ability, in fact, lies dormant in most of the
world’s population. Classes and research conducted with a cross-section of the population have
shown beyond doubt that with adequate training
and the use of the proper techniques the ability
can be placed literally at the fingertips of any individual interested enough to receive instruction. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Dermaoptics offers much to mankind, but offers even more to those who, either having been
born blind or having lost their sight after birth, are
without eyesight. We shall treat the sighted and
the unsighted separately in relation to dermaoptics, since the techniques involved in putting each
group in touch with this innate ability are somewhat different. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; First we shall consider dermaoptics as it affects both the congenitally blind and those who
through some trauma or disease became blind after
birth. To teach a person born blind to distinguish
color is a matter entirely different from teaching a
person who at least has some concept of the
meaning of the word color. This difference becomes clear in working with students who have
become sightless in their early teens or late twenties compared with students who were born blind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The unique difficulties involved in attempting to teach color distinction may become
clearer if one keeps in 0ne’s own mind what images the word color brings to him, and then considers the individual with no concept of what the
term connotes. It would be impossible to ask such
a person what color he feels has been placed in his
hands without first explaining to him what a
sighted person means by color. Add to this basic
obstacle the complexity of various tones and
shades in just one color; for example, the student
must learn not merely to distinguish blue from
red, but to distinguish light blue from dark blue,
royal blue from navy blue, and all the gradations
in between. This learning process is no small task
for either instructor or student. Patience and a facility to communicate ideas are the bedrocks on
which instruction must ultimately rest. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not intend here to teach people how to
instruct the blind in such techniques. As was mentioned previously, instruction in dermaoptics for&nbsp;those without the gift of eyesight must take its ownunique path. However, it is important to point out
some of the results obtained in using variations of
dermaoptics. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One case of a young man born blind, a student
we shall call Johnny, typifies other such cases. Johnny requested instruction in the techniques of
dermaoptics after speaking with a close friend,
also blind, who had been taught these methods.
The friend had learned not only how to distinguish colors through touch but also how to discern
the content of photographs and slides projected on
a wall as well as the content of everyday printed
matter—all through dermaoptics. Johnny’s friend
had one advantage: he had lost his sight at age 13
and could remember how colors looked. He also
understood the concept of various shades of the
same color. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; After speaking with Johnny, who at this time
was 18 years old, and explaining to him that most
likely no two sighted people see a color in exactly
the same way, instruction and training began. Johnny was told that what the sighted world
knows as color is actually made up of fields of energy that give off vibrations unique to each individual color; so he had to recognize a certain combination of vibrations, label it with the color name
humans had decided to give it, and be able to recall that label when he felt the same vibrations in
the future. In this way Iohnny learned to distinguish one color from another and apply the proper&nbsp;name to it, and he also was able to describe the
content of photographs by using variations of the
same technique. A new world has opened for Johnny, a world of which his mind could not previously conceive. Without the gift of eyesight the
dimension of color has come to have meaning and
importance in his life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Johnny’s friend Bill experienced a gradual
loss of sight until he became totally blind at 13.
Bill was anxious to learn the techniques for
bringing color back into his world and had some
very good reasons for wanting to work as hard as
necessary in order to accomplish this feat. Most
sighted people probably never would have considered many of the reasons that motivated this
oung man. In conversations he spoke of a desire
to be able to match his clothes so that colors went
well together, and to see photographs in family
albums and to spend some of his leisure time
looking at pictures in magazines. Bill worked
harder than any other student, blind or sighted,
that I have taught. Now he is able to distinguish
colors, describe the content of photographs, and
place his hands on or above a magazine article, letter, or book in ordinary print and comprehend the
theme of the written material. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; To date, no student trained through these
techniques can discern word-by-word content of
ordinary printed material; but research continues,
and possibly some day such content reading will
be an actuality for the blind. However, for a person
without eyesight to be able to discern the themes
of articles in everyday magazines is not inconsequential. The implications these results hold for
the many thousands of people without sight are
tremendous. A human being previously regarded
as handicapped becomes a functioning part of society! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Bill is a perfect example of how development
of these innate abilities can change a life. Totally
blind, he is now employed in a national ﬁrm
where a major part of his job entails work with
blueprints. Bill deserves much credit as an individual. His progress is a hopeful sign to countless
other blind students who can now find new sight,
not through their eyes, but through the techniques
of dermaoptics and extended sensory perception. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The reader may ask, “How are such things
possible?” Our theory is that a person can learn to
perceive color, sound, taste, fragrance, and touch
by extending the normally accepted limits of the
five senses. We further hold that since all things,
including color and printed material, ultimately
are composed of energy in one form or another, by
extending the senses one can learn to perceive and
interpret the vibrational fields that various energy
patterns project. To further explain this position
we theorize that although humans have divided
perception and allocated it, one form of perception
to one perceptor, the human body actually is itself
a sensing mechanism with power to receive and
interpret all perceptions through any area of its
surface. That is, it is possible not only to perceive
tactile sensations through the skin but also to learn
to hear, smell, see, and taste with any area of the
skin surface. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The components of this theory are extremely
important, for by making these assumptions it
becomes feasible to teach dermaoptics. In learning
to tap this ability, just as in learning to tap telepathic ability, the more one brings the senses into
play, the easier it seems to develop the faculty. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; To clarify this point let us consider how a
person can learn to distinguish, through touch
alone, the colors red and blue. By extending the
senses beyond normally accepted limitations the
individual quickly becomes aware that color consists of qualities he may never have considered.
Until he familiarizes himself with these other
qualities of color no attempt is made to enclose the
colored material in order to remove it from his line
of vision. (Remember here that we are dealing now
with instructions in dermaoptics for sighted
people.) Care is taken that the same material, composition, and size is used in each exercise, thereby
ruling out the possibility that a person might be
making a distinction not by extending his senses
but by perceiving a difference in size of the two
pieces of colored construction paper. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us begin with the color red. Consider the
possibility that the color red, or redness, has several unique qualities that no other color possesses.
After performing the breath exercises described in
Chapter 1 close your eyes and be aware of the
feeling of temperature connected with the color
red. Is there warmth or lack of warmth? Next, to
extend your sense of hearing and be aware of the
sound of redness, which may seem strange at first.
You will soon learn, though, that a deﬁnite and
unique sound is inherent in redness itself. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Attention is turned next to the sense of taste.
While holding the red construction paper between
your hands extend the sense of taste into the color
red and allow yourself to become aware of the
taste of redness. In using the olfactory sense, next
the reader is asked to become aware only of the
fragrance of redness. Texture is considered nextnot the texture of the paper, or any particular material, but the texture of redness itself. Does the
student experience redness as smooth, rough, soft,
or hard? Does the color red carry with it a sensation of movement or rest? What emotional feelings
are stimulated through the total perception of redness? All these factors must be considered, experienced, and assimilated. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader is asked to follow exactly the same
procedure with a sheet of blue construction paper
of the same size. After experiencing each of the
sensations mentioned for red, touch ﬁrst the red
piece of paper and then the blue in order to experience the same quality as uniquely expressed by
each color. Perform this exercise until you can
recognize the unique tastes, sounds, textures, and
fragrances of red and blue simply by placing your
hands on or above any material of these two
colors. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Using this same method, by means of practice
and recall you may enlarge your capacity for distinguishing colors and various shades of the same
color. When an individual has become proficient
in recognizing the unique qualities of both the
primary and secondary colors through touch
alone, he is ready to move to the next step, in
which the sighted person is taught to perceive pictures and written material sealed in opaque envelopes. Here, in addition to perceiving color, one
learns toldistinguish inanimate from animate objects, outdoor scenes from indoor photographs,
and emotional states portrayed in the photographs. For written material the student is taught
to comprehend an article or a poem enclosed in
the same type of envelope. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Various techniques allow the student to distinguish human beings from animals and plants
and, further, to identify speciﬁc species of animals. For example, to recognize that an animal is
in the photograph and to know that it is a rabbit
and not an elephant involves variations in techniques designed to allow the person to expand his
senses of touch and hearing. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In learning to sense inanimate objects a
person may receive a sealed opaque envelope that
contains a photograph of a kitchen. One is taught
to recognize such details as the presence of flowers
in a centerpiece, the pattern in the curtains,
whether the floor is carpeted or tiled, and the visible presence of cooking utensils and any visible
foods, as well as to identify the colors in the photograph. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; When photographs contain outdoor scenes,
such as a photograph of Maine’s rocky coastline,
students are able to identify the presence of, say,
the ocean, using their senses of hearing, touching,
tasting, and smelling. By extending his ordinarily
accepted five senses the student is able to perceive, experience, and interpret the presence of
sand and jagged rocks. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; As was stated, one of the most beautiful promises this technique holds for the sighted person is
the ability to experience conditions reflected in
the photograph itself. Thus one can not only look
at a picture of a thunderstorm but also feel the rain
and wind, smell the freshness of the air, hear the
thunder, and see the lighting. This form of total
perception makes it possible to experience a situation as a camera or an artist's brush captures it instead of merely looking at a picture and trying to
imagine the conditions reflected on a canvas or
roll of film. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One might well imagine the implications
these techniques hold for education. In addition to
offering creative educational methods for thousands of blind students, they bring an entirely different perspective to the business world in that the
blind possibly could be employed in many businesses and professions that have been closed to
them. The educator will have to reorient his
teaching methods to prepare blind students for the
increase in possible job opportunities. Blindness
will necessarily be viewed as less limiting, and a
new approach that concentrates on a student's
potential will replace the old view of education for
the blind. This educational approach will not be
limited by a world view that has seen the loss of
eyesight as an irrevocable handicap. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Educators who use these techniques will have
the opportunity to make experience important in
the educational process. A teacher will be able to
have his class experience hot, arrid deserts or cool,
moist lowlands rather than merely conveying descriptions and assigning readings. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The comprehension of written material by
means of these techniques promises a new method
in teaching students with learning disabilities and
reading problems. It also offers new hope to adults
who for one reason or another left school with
inadequate or poor reading skills. As with any
technique, reading comprehension through these
methods is not a panacea, but surely this form of
instruction opens new pathways in education. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In the comprehension of everyday printed
material the possibility that a person may be able
to learn word-by-word content reading through
this method has been considered and is now being
researched. Results so far have revealed an interesting problem that is related to the need, in the
beginning, to teach students to expand all areas of
awareness. In order to achieve content reading by
this method it becomes necessary to narrow the
field of expanded awareness by degrees. This delicate balance, involving expansion and contraction
of the perceptual ﬁeld, requires much time in
achievement. Small successes have to this time
been encouraging and have pointed the way toward modiﬁcation of the methods to allow for
greater accuracy in perceiving content verbatim.
At the present time students are able to identify
correctly several key words in a sentence, but the
technique for constricting the field of expanded
perception has not been sufficiently perfected to
allow for an exact reading of the order of words in
a sentence. Presently, though the student may be
able to pick out key words, the sequence in which
they are perceived is seldom accurate. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Several major thoughts should be considered
before we conclude this discussion of dermaoptics. Think for a moment about your own ideas and
feelings about blindness. Before the world's population views blindness from a perspective of what
is possible for the blind person rather than seeing
only his limitations, a change must occur in the
way people view blindness. Before our educational system puts into practice creative techniques for dealing with those our society labels
handicapped, society must understand that with
the proper instruction these people have much to
offer to it. You are such a person, and a member of
society. Think about the possibilities these techniques offer in the area of human resources and
evaluate them in your own mind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Someone once said that democracy is not the
perfect form of government, but it is the best we
have so far. These techniques are not cure alls, but
they offer more promise than any of the methods
previously available. We sincerely hope that further research and implementation of the techniques will bring this promise to fulfillment, but
before that happens each individual must allow
himself to see the benefits such techniques can
bring to our society and to our world. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Progress is made when man can see the possibilities in further investigation into a field; that is,
when man allows himself to see. Many people in
this nation are sightless and are labeled blind. A
wise man once said, “There are none so blind as
those who will not see.” <br>

                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PERCEIVING WORDS IN A SEALED <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ENVELOPE. 
              </span>
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Each person who participates in this exercise writes three unrelated words in English on a
piece of paper. For beginners the words should be
either nouns or verbs. The words should be
written in pencil when subjects are first learning
the technique, since for some reason vibratory
energy seems to be more easily interpreted in
written form when placed on the paper by means
of a soft lead pencil. As one progresses any plain
printed material will be read easily. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The papers are placed in opaque envelopes
and sealed. The envelopes should be exchanged so
that no participant holds his oum. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Hold the envelope between the palms of
the hands and perform the breath exercises outlined in Chapter 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Now unfocus your eyes, a task most easily
accomplished by staring downward and inward
toward the nose. Unfocusing the eyes will aid in
setting the conscious mind aside. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. While holding the envelope between the
palms of the hands and with the eyes out of focus,
allow yourself to be aware of any words, pictures,
or emotional sensations you experience. It is extremely important that impressions not be censored but written immediately on a separate sheet
of paper while holding the envelope in one hand. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. The impressions gained in this manner are
free flow impressions, and spontaneity cannot be
overemphasized. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. After writing dovm a minimum of six impressions open the envelope and compare your
impressions with the words taken from the envelope. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. You may notice that when you do not pick
up exactly the same words as those sealed in the
envelope you will have picked up words closely
associated with the sealed words. This phenomenon is very common and is similar to the technique used in artillery practice when a target is
ultimately hit by zeroing in from both sides. For
example, if the words on the paper in your envelope were sun, apple, and flight, you may have
written your impressions as bright, warm, fruit,
movement, running, and apple. Apple would, of
course, be a direct hit. Bright and warm are closely
associated with the word sun, and fruit also would
be considered as closely associated with apple.
The words movement and running can be directly
associated with flight. Only through practice will
you become proficient in this technique and move
from associative words to direct hits.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> PERCEIVING A PHOTOGRAPH IN A <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SEALED ENVELOPE.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. A nonparticipant should select photographs to be used. Place the photographs in
opaque envelopes and seal them. So that each participant has the opportunity to give his impressions of the contents of each envelope, the envelopes should be numbered sequentially. Five such
photographs should be used in learning this technique. The number, of course, may be enlarged,
but each participant should have the experience of
interpreting the contents of at least five envelopes. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Hold the envelope between the palms of
the hands. Breath exercises should be followed as
previously outlined, but with one variation. Imagine or will the breath exhaled through your hands.
This method allows for increased awareness
through the palms. The ancients taught, and research seems to bear them out, that consciousness
follows the breath. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Place your eyes out of focus as instructed
in the previous exercise and again allow free flow
of impressions to enter your awareness. Again you
are cautioned to write your impressions exactly as
received. If one begins to censor or question impressions, the conscious mind is brought into action, and extrasensory perception does not operate
on the level of the conscious mind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. After having written free flow impressions
you may question your higher awareness by
seeking more specific information about free flow
impressions. For example, if during this period of
free flow impressions you have received the energy pattern of an animal, you may receive more
speciﬁc information by extending your senses to
discern whether the animal has fur or a tough skin.
This form of questioning, the higher awareness,
allows great accuracy in interpretation. Allow one
minute for each envelope. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. After one minute the envelopes should be
exchanged and the same procedure followed with
the next photograph. Continue until each participant has written his impressions for five different
envelopes; note the number of each envelope next
to the impressions received from it. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. The nonparticipant now may collect the
envelopes and open them sequentially. For example, the envelope marked 1 should be opened and
the photograph held so that each participant can
see what the picture depicts and check correct
impressions. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. You will find that your accuracy greatly
increases as you continue to practice this technique. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation has become a frequently used
word in our society, even among children. It is
doubtful that all who use the word are fully aware
of its meaning, and if the meaning is clear to them
probably the process of entering a meditative state
is not at all clear. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Yogis have discussed meditation for centuries, but not until recent times has the Western
world turned its attention to this practice. Perhaps
the delay stems from cultural differences between
East and West. People raised in a Western culture
are taught to value actions and overt accomplishments. Probably each reader at one time in his life
has come across or heard the expressions: “An idle
mind is the devil's workshop”; “Busy hands are
happy hands”; “Keeping busy is the best way to
stay out of trouble." These expressions reflect an
orientation in Western society away from passive
states and toward action. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; An examination of Eastern societies—India,
for example—reveals an orientation not toward
outward activity but more toward inner reflection
and passive acceptance. Many stories are told of
Yogis who have sat under trees and meditated so
long that the roots of the trees have grown around
them. Since human beings often tend to exaggerate, this story probably does not actually reflect
facts, but it indicates the value system of a nation
oriented toward introspection and passive states
of awareness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be difficult to imagine a Western
businessman spending so much time in meditation under a tree. Ours is an industrial nation, and
the activity that keeps its wheels in motion is essential to its survival. Perhaps, as in most extremes, a philosophy that lies between these two
orientations and incorporates the best premises of
each will allow individuals very much in touch
with themselves to live in prosperous nations. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps Western civilization has taken so
long to consider the benefits to be derived through
meditative states because until very recently the
West has viewed meditation as a religious practice, engaged in by persons who had committed
their lives to monasteries or convents. Monks,
abbots, priests, and nuns came to mind when meditation was mentioned. Today, after many radical
changes in the religious orders, meditation has
moved outside religion. Businessmen, housewives, high school and college students are
reading books and taking courses in the practice of
meditation. Certainly not all or even most of these
people want to learn meditation in order to reach
the state of samadi, the state of perfect attunement
with the universe and the Absolute. People are
becoming aware that in addition to its use in attaining such a state of awareness, the practice of
meditation affords many side benefits, not the
least of which is a state of calmness. Consider the
millions of dollars spent for tranquilizers each
year in this country alone, and it becomes clear
that a feeling of tranquility is greatly sought after.
Meditation affords a natural means of attaining
inner peace together with a major reduction in
drug bills. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to answer the question “What is meditation?" we will consider first some of the Yoga
teachings. A Yogi meditates in order to reach a
state of unity with creation and the Creator. Meditation for the Yogi is a process directed at the attainment of unity through a stilling of the conscious mind, thereby expanding awareness. This
process affords the individual an opportunity to
experience higher states of consciousness and ultimately a state of pure beingness. Yogis do not
meditate in order to activate clairvoyant, telepathic, and other abilities usually thought of as
extrasensory perception. These abilities are under
the conscious control of many Yogis, but such control is not the aim of their meditation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; For the Yogi one means of facilitating the attaimnent of unity is to awaken the chakras—points
where energy can flow from one body to another.
Yogis believe that the human is made up of interpenetrating bodies, each an exact duplicate of the
other and each composed of energy moving at various rates of speed in relation to the movement of
molecules in the human body. This belief needs
no detailed discussion here; the reader need only
understand that for the Yogi meditation entails
stimulation of these chakras by oxygen circulated
through the bodies. The seven chakras range from
the base of the spine to the top of the head; thus
Yogis believe that meditation should be practiced
with the spine straight and erect. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Sound has been used for centuries to induce a
state of higher attunement. Mantras, collections of
words that when chanted produce specific sounds,
have been used extensively to put the conscious
mind aside and elevate the awareness to full unity.
Mantras are still used today and are being used in
the Western hemisphere. Yogis conceive of the
word om as being the cosmic sound, and it is often
chanted vocally and mentally while entering a
meditative state. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Meditation mantras have been used in many
different societies. The American Indian used a
form of meditation mantras and sacred dances to
achieve higher states of awareness. Man through
the centuries apparently has believed in the power
of words and sound to bring about changes in the
material world. The Roman Catholic church has
made extensive use of Gregorian chant, and
chanting very frequently precedes meditation in
religious orders. St. Augustine once said in reference to the use of chants, “To sing is to pray
twice." <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A second answer to the question of what meditation is comes from the scientist. Even though it
has taken many thousands of years for science to
attempt an answer, much research has been conducted and is continuing today in many universities and colleges. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A study of brain waves emitted during a meditative state has shown that cerebral activity in
such a state is markedly different from activity
during routine existence. By means of the electroencephalograph (EEG) it has been determined
that during meditation the brain emits a rather
constant flow of alpha rhythms. As the meditative
state deepens, the EEG reflects the emission of
theta rhythms. Both of these states are indicative
of less cortical activity and an increase in serenity,
and have been found to correlate in a positive
manner with states conducive to creativity. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader must be careful not to confuse
these states with that brought about by sleep. It has
been shown through research on the brain's activity during various levels of sleep that when one
is sleeping on a very deep level the brain emits
delta rhythms. All these rhythms of the brain, as
reflected by the EEG, differ from the brain waves
emitted while engaging in everyday activity, when
beta rhythms are most commonly emitted. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Science has also found it possible to train
people to produce alpha and theta rhythms at will.
Such teaching methods always involve the use of
an EEG or biofeedback equipment, because only
with the use of such equipment can one know
with certainty that he is producing alpha or theta
rhythms. The reader should keep this point in
mind if he ever considers a course of study that
claims instruction in the production of brain
waves. Without the use of biofeedback there is no
sure way of knowing that one is producing alpha
rhythms or theta rhythms. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Laboratory tests conducted on blood samples
taken from persons before, during, and after meditation show that the lactate level in the blood decreases during the meditative state. This physiological measure indicates a decrease in anxiety
level and is a sign of greater calmness. It has also
been found that blood pressure is lowered during a
meditative state, with a corresponding retardation
of the heartbeat. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Unquestionably the meditative state does
produce measurable changes in the human body.
The direction of change indicates that meditation
is instrumental in bringing about creative states,
heightened perceptual awareness, and a feeling of
serenity within the individual. Thus the production of meditative states may offer much in the
field of psychotherapy. The psychotherapist may
aid his patients by instructing them in the practice
of meditation. Large numbers of psychotherapists
have claimed that anxiety is one of the chief problems for therapy. If the therapist can provide his
patient with a relatively quick means of relieving
anxiety feelings, therapy sessions certainly will be
more productive, and the patient will find that this
new feeling of serenity has a positive effect on his
everyday life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Psychotherapy may benefit through many of
the areas of parapsychology. Clairvoyance and telepathy may enable the therapist to gain greater
insights into his patients’ problems, and meditation offers the patient the possibility of early relief
of anxiety. Research in this area is needed to discover the means by which parapsychology can
best aid the therapist. Then patients could benefit
from the newly opened avenues of heightened
self-awareness that lead to greater fulfillment of
human potential. The research being conducted
now in Atlanta, Georgia, has not yet produced
conclusive findings, but indications are that new
inroads will be made in the field of psychotherapy
using parapsychological techniques. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Though many people may believe that the
better way is to continue the search for breakthroughs in what they may consider more conventional areas, we cannot help but feel that parapsychology will open many doors previously closed
to the researcher. We are reminded of the Zen
story of the man who clings to the window bars
when the door behind him is open! An open door
invites scientists and others to pass through toward the light beyond and discover new techniques for tapping and enriching human potential. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> There are many techniques for entering a
meditative state. Here are several methods for the
reader's consideration. No single technique described will work well for every person; so it is
very important that one try different meditation
methods and remain with the one he finds most
beneficial in the practice of meditation.&nbsp;<br>
            <br> 102<br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> &nbsp; CIRCULATION OF THE BREATH.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Most important is the proper meditation
posture. You may want to meditate lying down or
seated in a chair, but in either case the position
chosen should be comfortable and the spine
should be kept straight. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Choose a chair with a back high enough to
support the head. Place the feet flat on the floor
and keep the arms uncrossed. The palms of the
hands should be left in an upturned position with
the backs of the hands resting on the thighs. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Close your eyes and pay particular attention to your breathing but make no effort to control
the breath. As you watch the breath you will find
that the breathing process will be naturally slowed
and deepened. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Since according to occult teachings, the
breath enters the body and travels downward
along the spine, make a conscious effort to control
the breath and recirculate it so as to carry it back
up the spine and into the area of the pineal gland
(to the occult, the third eye). <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. In order to control the breathing and recirculate the breath in this manner, after watching
the breathing process without interference, become aware of the breath’s deepening and slowing
and begin conscious control. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Control of the breath must never become a
contest of endurance. Suggested measured counts
for inhalation, hold and circulation, and exhalation are given here with a caution to begin with a
number comfortable for you and increase the
count as you progress naturally. All breathing
should be from the diaphragm so that on inhalation the diaphragm and abdomen become slightly
extended. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Begin by inhaling to a measured count of
three; relax the stomach muscles immediately
when the inhalation is complete. Visualize the
breath’s traveling down the spinal column, turning, and recirculating up the spinal canal to the
pineal gland just above and between the eyebrows.
This circulation should be visualized to the measured mental count of six. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. After circulation of the breath, exhale
through the nostrils to a measured count of three.
This process of inhalation, hold, circulation, and
exhalation should he performed four times. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 9. Then simply allow yourself to become
aware of your own consciousness and follow the
pattern of thoughts that enter into your awareness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 10. This exercise in meditative awareness
should continue for no longer than 15 or 20 minutes. This time period is also suggested for the various techniques that follow. As you become more
practiced in meditation you may want to extend
your meditation to two sessions per day. Then
early morning and early evening are suggested. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 11. For this meditative technique, as for all
that follow, attempt to choose one particular location, which should be as free from noise as possible. The telephone should be adjusted so as to
avoid an interruption by an unexpected call. If
possible, meditate at a previously arranged time
and become accustomed to having this period set
aside for meditation. We do not mean to imply that
your life should revolve around your meditation
schedule but only that you should adhere to a
speciﬁed time as often as is reasonably possible.&nbsp;<br>
            <br> 104<br>
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> PROJECTION TOWARD THE LIGHT.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. This technique, as all methods enumerated
here, may be used either seated or in a prone position. For illustration we shall use the prone position. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Lie flat on your back and perform the
breathing technique outlined in the first exercise. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. With the eyes closed visualize a pinpoint
of light outside yourself, just in front of the third
eye. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Be conscious only of the pinpoint of light
and will your awareness to move toward and into
this light. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. If any thought of the day enters your awareness you should set the thought aside and continue conscious projection toward and into the
light. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Allow awareness only of the light and
beingness while consciously projecting, always
deeper, into its composition. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. This technique is extremely good for the
experience of pure existence. It has an intense
calming effect that will remain with you long after
the meditation exercise has been completed.&nbsp;<br>
            <br> 105<br>
            <br>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COLOR MEDITATION.</span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. After performing the breath exercises outlined in the first exercise, select a color. Blue is
suggested. Visualize a field of dark blue light outside yourself and just above the third eye region. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Consciously project yourself into the color
blue, experiencing as you do the qualities of blueness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Keep the awareness focused on blueness
itself, and give particular attention to the sound,
fragrance, taste, and texture associated with the
color. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Allow your awareness to become permeated by these qualities. Blue has a particularly
calming effect and is a great aid in expanding philosophical awareness. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Again, all thoughts concerned with daily
activities should be set aside. The consciousness
should be brought back to the experience of the
innate qualities of the color blue. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Other colors may be chosen. For the particular qualities associated with colors, refer to
Chapter 3, “Human Aura,” where the signiﬁcance
of colors was discussed.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp; THE PROJECTION SCREEN <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; TECHNIQUE.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Perform the exercise for circulation of
breath. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Visualize a pure white projection screen
outside yourself and, again, before and above the
third eye area. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Keep all awareness focused on this screen,
and allow your awareness to follow the flow of any
thoughts, forms, sensations, or pictures that play
on the screen. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Whenever a scene is projected across this
mental screen visualize and project yourself into
and through the outward appearance of such a
scene. This will allow you to experience the inner
qualities associated with form, color, and thought. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Problem-solving by this technique may be
accomplished by visualizing the projection screen,
mentally stating the problem to which you are
seeking a solution, and placing all your awareness
on the screen. The pictures that play across the
screen often will portray the solution. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Keep in mind that you must always project
yourself through whatever plays across the screen,
for meditation implies a deepening awareness and
a constant penetration into whatever appearances
occur.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp; SOUND MEDITATION THROUGH <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUSIC.<br>
            </span>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Select classical or semiclassical recorded
music that appeals to you. The theme from 2001
(“Also Sprach Zarathustra") is suggested as an
appropriate musical score for the practice of meditation with sound. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. As the music begins, lie flat on your back,
close your eyes, and watch your breath but make
no attempt to control it. Watch the breath in this
manner for approximately 30 seconds; then turn
your full awareness to the music. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Project yourself into each note and be carried up and down the musical scale so that your
consciousness becomes entwined with the melody
itself. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. If possible, position your body in such a
way that vibrations that fill the room can be felt
physically. This sensation can be an aid in allowing your consciousness to become the music. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Like the music, allow your consciousness to
fill all space. Flow with it into every corner of the
room. With the vibrations of music penetrate the
walls of the room, and project yourself as music
into infinite space. You may be surprised, particularly with the Zarathustra theme, to ﬁnd yourself
experiencing creation itself and penetrating
through creation to whatever force has set it in
motion. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Continue this meditation for at least one
minute after the music has stopped. You will find
that a calm state of exhilaration and expanded
awareness will remain with you long after the exercise. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Practice each of these techniques for one week
before deciding which method offers you the
greatest benefit in meditation. You may find a
combination of techniques most profitable. Whatever works best for you is for you the best method
of meditation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; With practice you may develop variations of
several techniques. Variations are encouraged if
they aid entrance into a meditative state of unity
with all that is! <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Many books have been written on the subject
of positive mental attitude and the effect it can
have in everyday living. We shall not attempt here
to encourage a Pollyanna outlook on life but shall
state some basic facts and a hypothesis that suggests that man is the creator of his own future. We
are not speaking here of the past built day on day,
one event leading to another. Right now, in fact,
the reader possesses the ability to bring into his
life future circumstances and events by mentally
creating those events today! This may seem astounding, but as one reads on it will become clear
to him that he has more control over his future
than he ever dreamed.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Since time is not an absolute commodity but a
flowing continuum, man has the ability to project
his thoughts into what at this time he considers
the future and to form it in the pattern he desires.
The basis for this ability is that all things, including time and thought, consist of energy. It has
already been shown in Chapter 4 that with psy-
chokinetic energy man can affect his physical
body and objects external to him. This same energy in the form of thought can be used to construct specific events in everyday life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the possibility, since time is not absolute, that the future is a very fluid state. To
illustrate, let us compare this fluidity with molten
wax, capable of being molded into various forms.
Then consider that thoughts projected onto this
molten wax can act as molds that shape the wax
according to the will of the individual. Thoughts
are not abstract fantasies that possess no true substance. Thoughts are things! They consist of energy patterns capable of affecting everything they
contact. The energy of thought can be used as so
many seeds sown now in order to produce a specific crop at a specific future time. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The implications of such a hypothesis are extremely far-reaching, for if this theory is correct it
places on each individual the responsibility for
either accepting things as they are or actively
doing something to bring about the circumstances
he wants. If one chooses passive acceptance he
cannot reasonably complain that circumstances
are not to his liking and are holding him back. If
one chooses action he still has no grounds for
complaint, because the energy of one’s own
thoughts and the patterns that energy takes form
the circumstances that surround one. If circumstances are not to a person’s liking he has only to
change his mental attitude and form a mental picture of the circumstances he wants in order to
change his life situation. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The science of quatum physics has been used
to research the nature of time. Scientists in this
area have found evidence to suggest that time
flows backward as well as forward, lending support to the belief that time is truly relative and the
future truly fluid. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists who have researched precognition
and psychokinetic energy as they relate to control
of future events have concluded that an individual
may bring about a desired event in the future
through the use of thought and psychokinetic energy patterns. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; As an aid to understanding the concept of a
fluid future let us use the analogy of a roll of film.
Picture a camera that contains a roll of film ca-
pahle of 12 exposures. Consider that three sections
of this roll already have been exposed, leaving
nine sections potentially capable of capturing any
situation. If the person who takes the picture
chooses, he may photograph a building, an indoor
scene, a mountain scene, or the busy activity of
rush-hour traffic. The film itself is capable of accepting for future presentation any of these scenes,
but the one actually etched on each section is at
the discretion of the individual who takes the pictures. Time is much like a roll of film. Exposed
sections depict the past; sections being exposed
reflect the present; sections capable of exposure at
another time show the future. Thus the future is
comparable to unexposed sections on a roll of
film. Whatever appears in the future is determined
by the desires of the photographer. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Scientiﬁcally it has been shown that many
individuals have the ability to expose ﬁlm in a
camera by the sheer power of thought. Many reputable scientists have investigated this phenomenon in strict laboratory conditions and have concluded that it is indeed possible through thought
to project an image which actually forms on a photographic plate or roll of film where there was no
possibility of exposure through ordinary means.
These facts should give the reader an appreciation
for the power of his own thinking. The future
ahead holds an infinite number of possible exposures. Each individual can create in his life the
circumstances or prints he desires! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader should keep in mind that certain
circumstances already have been thrust into the
future by thought patterns emitted to this time. As
no two things can occupy the same space at the
same time, in constructing future events to one’s
liking it is to be expected that previous events that
are taking shape will be torn down. A perfect example is the student who has directed all the energy of his thoughts toward a career in business
and then has decided to reconstruct his future and
has begun to visualize circumstances that will
permit him to enter medical school. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever a person attempts to reconstruct his
future he may have to deal with the emotional reactions of people who have already responded to
the earlier patterns of thought. This change in lifestyle and goals may find family members or business partners confused or angry as they are confronted with the new circumstances. Therefore,
one should not be surprised if during the reordering of a previously implanted event he experiences some discomfort in possibly having to deal
with the reactions of other people concerned with
those events up to this point. Reconstruction is
generally for the purpose of building something
better, and the concept of building a future with
thought should be considered in the same way. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Rebuilding and new construction of thoughts
always should be for a constructive purpose; otherwise great havoc can result. This warning is of
utmost importance and must be considered seriously. In the construction of future events,
thoughts are an actual and powerful method of
bringing circumstances into one’s life! We caution
the reader not to underestimate this technique in
considering the simplicity of the methodology
behind it. It works, and it works with great accuracy. Don't make the mistake of using it as a toy,
for it is capable of rearranging every area of life! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The dangers inherent in the technique are illustrated in the story of a young female Georgia
State student who despite the cautions decided to
visualize a young man—who had to this point
shown her no special attention—entering her life
in a significant way and showering her with special concern. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One week later the young woman reported
that after a week of visualization the young man
had asked her for three dates during the past week.
She was delighted and at the same time astounded
that the technique had worked so quickly. Three
months later at a college in Macon, Georgia, this
same young woman appeared and asked how to
visualize the young man out of her life. She said
that his special concerns were driving her to distraction! He was, in fact, so solicitous of her wellbeing that together they had managed to demolish&nbsp;her social life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The young woman could only again reorder
her life by creating new circumstances around it.
She would have to deal with the young man’s reactions and the discomfort that would be engendered by the reordering. It is safe to say that the
woman will never again take this method so
lightly. She will consider the harvest well and
long before using thought to seed a fluid future for
desired events. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Not all people who attempt to use this method
err on the side of overenthusiasm. Some individuals who attempt to build future events undermine their efforts with countless doubts and such
statements as “Well, if it works ...” or “Do you
really think something so simple can work?” This
pessimism is analogous to building the foundation
for a house in the morning and chipping away at it
in the afternoon. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The technique should be seen for what it is;
there is nothing magical about it. It involves only
the use of mental and psychokinetic energy as a
stamp to imprint on the fluidity of the future the
events one wants to occur. It is composed, not of
the ingredients in a magic formula or potion, but
only of the nature of time in relation to the energy
patterns of thought. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; It is important that the reader appreciate that
the energy patterns of thought are pseudomagnetic
in quality. One does not attract the opposite of
what one thinks about; instead, one’s thoughts attract similar conditions. More simply, one gets
what one gives, whether it is in the form of
thoughts or of actions. Each person creates his
own future by attracting to himself persons, actions, and circumstances that reflect his thought
patterns. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This attraction may explain the loser cycle seen
so much today in our society. Employers and major
institutions spend millions of dollars yearlyto motivate employees and management personnel to think
constructively. Sad, but true indeed, is that most
of this money is spent in vain. Pep rallies and rahrah seminars never will produce a lasting effect
on attitudes and thought patterns. An explanation of the dynamics underlying the process of
visualization would be much more advantageous
to businesses, institutions, and society as a whole. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A person who is turned on to the power
within himself and knows that he needs no magic
words or formulas to achieve success will have no
need for pep rallies. The person who is taught that
his own mind is the most powerful force in the
creation of his future, who is in touch with the
laws for the beneficial use of this force becomes a
truly self-motivating and self-actualizing individual. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Needless to say that to begin such training in
childhood would allow derivation of positive benefits over a much longer period of time. People
also would not need to relinquish childhood attitudes and thought patterns that inclined them
toward the loser’s cycle as adults. How much more
simple for both teacher and student to have only to
teach and learn what is necessary rather than
having to correct past teachings not conducive to
the achievement of life goals before proceeding
with a pragmatic constructive approach. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The ideal definition of education may be
stated simply as teaching in such a way that the
material presented will not have to be cast off in
the future. If we could present to our children the
concept that thoughts are real things and bring
about direct and often immediate reaction, we
might then have a society much less bent toward
chaotic situations—a society comprised of people
who recognize that today's thoughts become tomorrow's actions and circumstances. Such people
might be considered more sane because they realize that thought is creative energy in motion, and
they accept responsibility for circumstances that
exist in their lives, society, and the world.
Someone once said, “The longest journey begins
with the first step.” We would add to this that everything that exists began with a thought! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the energy of thought is such a powerful
force in our world, the individual who uses the
process of visualization should understand that it
must be done with accuracy. Our thoughts find
material form exactly as they are sent out. An illustration of this need for accuracy is an incident that
occurred in the life of a Georgia State University
student who disregarded the caution. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; After learning the technique of visualization
the young student planned to use the method to
attract to herself a man with the precise qualities
she desired. She visualized a man who was extremely masculine, very decisive, interested in art,
tall, handsome, and highly intelligent. Ten days
later while performing the very unromantic task of
taking out the garbage, she was approached by a
man who lived in her apartment complex. He was
tall, good-looking, extremely masculine, and intelligent. He asked if he could speak with her later
that evening, and she agreed. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; At this later meeting the man told the young
woman that he was terribly attracted to her and
wanted her to see him regularly. When the woman
mentioned that she knew he was married and
living with his wife, he saw this as only a minor
obstacle. She did not, and explained to him that
although she was flattered by his attention she felt
too many “minor obstacles” lay in their path to
becoming better acquainted. Among these obstacles was the span between her 24 years and
this charming gentleman’s 82 years. The man certainly fulfilled every aspect of her visualization,
but she had forgotten to visualize his age and marital state. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The situation was straightened out, and the
young woman was able to see the element of
comedy. She vows, however, to be much more
cautious in using visualization in the future. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We want to emphasize that visualization is
much more than a trend toward positive thinking;
it involves the realization that natural laws are
responsible for its efficiency, and it requires that
one act as if the visualized circumstances were
already a reality. For this reason submerged
doubts tear away at constructive visualization. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Visualization requires that one visualize the
desired circumstances at least three times a day.
This repetition adds momentum to the energy of
thought released into a fluid future. If one plans to
bring specific circumstances into one’s life but
visualizes these circumstances only three or four
times before discontinuing the practice, he may
ask, “What happens to the energy of the thoughts
released?” Without the momentum gained
through repetition, the energy previously released
will be depleted and not sufficiently strong to
mold the fluid future. This winding down process
often explains why many people who begin visualization enthusiastically but stop visualizing
after only three or four sessions never see their
thoughts materialize. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Several important points should be made in
summary. First, visualization is not a toy but a
very sound procedure whose roots spring from the
nature of time and energy. Second, there is no
magic in any object or set of words. True power for
creative action lies within the mind of each
person. He has only to become aware of this force
to be able to use it constructively. Third, the energy of our thoughts takes material form exactly as
the thoughts were structured. Thus accuracy in
visualization is extremely important. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Hopefully the force of visualization will become a powerful tool for constructive purposes in
your life and you will begin to teach the technique
to your own children or to those for whom you are
in some way responsible. Do not use visualization
without serious thought and due consideration of
the circumstances you are attempting to bring
about in your life, to paraphrase a well-known
comedian, “What you visualizes is what you <br>gets!” <br>

            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. You must have in your mind a clear picture
of the circumstances you want to see materialize. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Give proper consideration to the outcome
of the rnaterialization of such circumstances in
order to make certain that their material creation
will be beneficial and constructive in your life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Perform the breath exercises detailed in
Chapter 1. Breath adds energy and momentum to
the power of thought. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. With eyes closed, visualize the circumstances you want to bring about by seeing them in
your mind’s eye, as if they were already a reality in
material form. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Continue this visualization process for at
least one full minute. As you increase your ability
for concentration and visualization, the visualization process may be extended to two minutes. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. This process should be repeated at least
three and no more than five times a day. The
process should be carried on until the circumstances being visualized have taken material form. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Materialization of circumstances generally
takes from five days to one month, depending on
the complexity in construction of such circumstances and whether the individual allowed any
doubts, which automatically slow down the materialization process.&nbsp;<br>

            </span>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. After you have given time and consideration to the desirability of a circumstance you want
to bring about in your life, you are ready to produce a mental motion picture that depicts those
circumstances. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. In this process you become script writer,
director, and producer of a mental film that portrays your own future. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Perform the breath exercises outlined in
Chapter 1. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. In a comfortable position and with eyes
closed, construct a mental image that contains the
people and circumstances to be included in your
visualization. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Mentally construct the scene—for example, office setting, home situation—in which the
characters in your mental film are to interact. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Have a clear picture of the people to be included in this scene. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Since you write the script, mentally see
and hear each individual speaking your words and
other people reacting to these spoken words exactly as you would have them react. For example,
if you want to visualize being promoted at your
place of employment, the mental film you produce
might run as follows. Youmay visualize yourself
at your desk, speaking with an employee directly
over you in the chain of command. You will hear
the employee say, “Mr. Smith wants to see you in
his office, I think he has good news for you." Then
you will hear yourself say “Thanks a lot,” and see
yourself leave your desk and walk to your superior’s office. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; On entering the office you will hear yourself
say, “Mr. Iones said you wanted to see me, sir.”
With a clear picture of Mr. Smith seated at his desk
you will hear Mr. Smith say, “Yes, George, l did. I
have some good news for you. You're being promoted to the head of your department. The increase in pay and your new duties will start tomorrow. We have been very pleased with your
performance in the past, and we know you will do
a good job for us in this position in the future."
You will then hear yourself respond, “Thank you
very much, Mr. Smith. I appreciate your confidence, and I know I will do a good job for the company.” The mental movie can stop here, since this
would signify completion of the circumstances
desired. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 8. The mental film should be run at least
three and no more than five times per day until the
desired circumstances have materialized. <br>

VISUALIZATION WITH THE AID <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OF PHOTOGRAPHS.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. This form of visualization is particularly
effective for the attainment of some material item
you want to bring into your life. As before, you
should consider well what changes the acquisition
of such an item might bring into your life. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. After performing the exercises in breathing
techniques you should assume a relaxed position
and mentally construct an image of the object you
want to acquire. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. A photograph of the object itself, or one
that reflects such an object, is a helpful tool in visualization by this method. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Place the photograph or photographs in an
envelope. It makes no difference whether the photograph has been cut from a magazine or is an actual print from a roll of film. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Use this picture to increase your ability to
form a strong mental image of the object you want.
After performing the prescribed breath techniques
and while seated in a comfortable position, look at
the photograph with full concentration for approximately 30 seconds. Then close your eyes and see
yourself in possession of that particular item; for
example, if the object is an automobile you may
have cut an automobile advertisement from a magazine. After concentrating on the picture, in order
to present the image clearly to your mind close
your eyes and see yourself behind the wheel,
driving down your own street. Visualize yourself
parking the car in front of your own house or
apartment and hearing someone say, “Nice car ...
when did you get it?” Then hear yourself respond,
“I just got it today. It's a real beauty isn't it?” <br> 6. This process of visualization, as in the
other exercises, should be performed at least three
times and not more than five times per day until
acquisition of the desired object becomes a reality. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This technique, especially advantageous to
those who at first ﬁnd it difficult to create and
hold strong mental images, will facilitate the development of such an ability. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Any reader who wants to research ethics can
find innumerable books on the subject as well as
innumerable books that discuss ethics along with
other matters. The question of ethics has been considered by such people as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas
Aquinas, Teilhard de Chardin, I. Krishnamurti,
and countless others. If all the names were listed
they would form a book. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The question of ethics penetrates every area of
human life. The laborer, the college student, and
the scientist all find themselves at one time or another confronted with ethics in the form of moral
values. Although moral values may vary slightly
from nation to nation some seem almost universal
in civilized societies. Most cultures respect life
and value the individual’s right to privacy. As
progress brings change, mankind faces the same
ethical questions faced in the past and dealt with
according to the circumstances and laws that existed at that time in the society. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; What reader has not seen a movie or read a
book concerned in some way, perhaps a major
way, with the ethical problems scientists face?
What reader in the civilized world today has not at
some time actively participated in or actively listened to a discussion of the moral question involved in the use of nuclear energy and warfare? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The cheers that went up when Iapan surrendered and World War II ended were followed in
time by the often-asked question: “Were we as a
nation morally justified in dropping the atomic
bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?” Some were
quick to point an accusing finger at the scientist in
an attempt to place responsibility on those who
had made possible the use of such a device. We
shall not argue here for or against justification in
the atomic bombing of these two Iapanese cities
but shall deal with the question of scientific responsibility for such an event. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Progress brings with it many changes to which
man must adjust his mode of thinking and behaving. In considering the question of right and
wrong, good and bad, blessing or curse, the reader
should look within this mode of response to progress, for here man makes a choice of how and to
what ends he will use the tools science gives him.
No discovery or material object is good or bad in or
of itself. Good and evil enter our world in the uses
to which men put discoveries and material objects.
When an individual or a nation makes a conscious
choice to use a law, an object, or a theory in a way
they know to be hurtful to others, either by infringing on their human rights or by doing them
bodily harm, that choice has introduced evil into
the world. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; People who are aware of the potential good a
specific scientific discovery may offer ask another
question that attempts to place on science responsibility for the results of progress: “What about
people who will use this discovery in the wrong
way?" In answer to this question it must be
pointed out that everything that exists could be
used “in the wrong way.” Every new discovery,
mankind's every progressive step, is in danger of
being used by some people in a way that proves
hurtful to others. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Agriculture, which began to be used extensively about 8,000 years ago, is an example of just
such a giant step in human progress. Most readers
surely would agree that food cultivation is one of
man‘s greatest blessings. Progress in agriculture
has allowed the world to feed its people; nations
with more advanced agricultural techniques teach
these techniques and/or sell food to nations not so
advanced. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists now are looking for ways to introduce the techniques of agriculture to ocean beds so
that in the future earth may be able to produce sufficient food to feed its growing population. People
are looking hopefully to agriculture for the answer
to the question: “How can we have enough food to
feed our growing numbers on this planet?” <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; These same people who look to agriculture
with such hope may never have considered that
not until the advent of agriculture did land become an extremely valuable commodity that
caused men to fight army against army, nation
against nation for the right to its possession. Class
distinctions were created as society divided into
those who owned and those who worked the land
and, later, into those who made and those who
sold implements to till the soil. Many people became wealthy—some at the expense of their neighbors. All this fragmentation of a society previously
without agriculture was brought about by the uses
and purposes to which men applied its discovery.
Will the reader now attempt to answer the question: “Is agriculture a blessing or a curse?" With
the history of agriculture in mind one can see that
a cut and dried answer, a simple yes or no, is
hardly possible. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This example shows that each new discovery
is like a two-sided coin. Iust as no one-sided coins
exist, so nothing is known to man that cannot by
his discretion and choice be misused. Perhaps the
better part of valor in attempting to answer the
blessing-or-curse question is to weigh the potentially good uses of a new discovery against the
number of people in the world who will misuse
the same discovery. It is not reasonable to call an
end to discovery in order to correct such misuse. It
is more feasible to educate and train people in
such a way that they will choose to use scientific
discoveries in a manner beneficial to mankind. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The relevance of ethics to the science of parapsychology becomes clear when one recognizes
the powerful significance of discoveries in this
field. The ability to communicate mind to mind or
through clairvoyance to possess specific facts
about both the past and the future is threatening to
some people who view these abilities as potentially capable of infringing on their right to privacy. We emphasize again that no ability is in and
of itself good or bad. Some people may, and most
likely will, misuse their talents. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the greatest forces available to mankind against such misuse is education of the general public in parapsychology. Through mass education we can prevent this knowledge from
becoming the esoteric possession of a few individuals or nations. Through education and by encouraging people to develop parapsychological abilities within themselves we can also reduce the
number of persons who make a lucrative living by
using such abilities to entertain or advise. People
who seek advice are willing to pay someone they
believe is special or gifted. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; There will always be those who have developed these abilities more fully than others, just as
there are those who play the piano for their own
enjoyment and those who play well enough to give
a concert. However, through general education
and knowledge we can help the public to distinguish among those who have developed their abilities as has the concert pianist. People so educated
will be able to recognize those who offer much and
deliver little as they become ﬁnancially well off. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The person who seeks clairvoyant information owes to himself an ethical obligation that consists of his responsibility to investigate as tar as
possible the qualiﬁcations of the clairvoyant or
psychic. The public can greatly curtail fraudulent
psychics by being discriminating in those they
seek out and prices they are willing to pay. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Each person is always responsible to himself
in any area that involves dependence on another.
Frauds can make a living by commercializing their
abilities, real or imaginary, because many people
are willing to shed decision-making responsibilities by happily following the advice of one who
supposedly knows best. Some readers may be astounded to learn about some of the advice supposedly intelligent people seek from so-called
psychics who set up businesses beside highways
or main thoroughfares. Questions include: Will I
take a trip this summer? Should I sell my house?
Should I change jobs? Should I marry the person
I’m dating? Will my husband and I straighten out
our marital problems? And the winner of all questions: Should we get a divorce? When one considers that 99 percent of these wayside psychics
have had no training in vocational guidance, marriage counseling, or psychotherapy, it is more than
a little frightening to know that people make decisions based on what these psychics tell them. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; A much needed regulatory body composed of
persons qualified in both parapsychology and
counseling or psychotherapy could maintain a register of persons who practice in various fields of
the psychic sciences. The register would include
their qualifications in the field in which they
claim expertise, and this information could be
made available to the public on request. As a sort
of better business bureau this regulatory body
could also keep a list of complaints registered
against any persons who claim to give psychic information or advice. Any person’s inclusion on the
register would be a voluntary matter. This register
would be an attempt to maintain ethical standards
and protect the public; so ethical practitioners interested in doing both would gladly allow themselves to be listed. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Such a register is being formed now through
Psychic Science Institute, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to research and education. Psychic Science Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, will accept applications from people throughout the country.
This register is not the ultimate answer to the ethical question of the qualification of those in the
psychic sciences, but it is a constructive move
away from destructive criticism about what has
not been done! <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The future holds great promise for new developments through the science of parapsychology.
With the research already in progress in dermaoptics, the future hopefully will bring these techniques to the point where they can beneﬁt all of
the world’s blind, visually handicapped, and slow
readers. Man does not exist to serve science; science exists to serve man! How better can science
serve than to give the knowledge and techniques
that enable men to discover and enrich their own
human potential? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the promise of parapsychology. <br>
